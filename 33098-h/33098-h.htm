<h3><br />PREFACE.</h3>


<p>An endeavour has been made in this handbook, as far as space
and scantiness of material would permit, to trace the history of
the development of wooden ships from the earliest times down
to our own. Unfortunately, the task has been exceedingly
difficult; for the annals of shipbuilding have been very badly
kept down to a quite recent period, and the statements made
by old writers concerning ships are not only meagre but often
extremely inaccurate. Moreover, the drawings and paintings
of vessels which have survived from the classical period are
few and far between, and were made by artists who thought
more of pictorial effect than of accuracy of detail. Fortunately
the carvings of the ancient Egyptians were an exception to the
above rule. Thanks to their practice of recording and illustrating
their history in one of the most imperishable of materials
we know more of their ships and maritime expeditions than we
do of those of any other people of antiquity. If their draughtsmen
were as conscientious in delineating their boats as
they were in their drawings of animals and buildings, we
may accept the illustrations of Egyptian vessels which have
survived into our epoch as being correct in their main features.
The researches now being systematically carried out in the
Valley of the Nile add, year by year, to our knowledge, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
already we know enough to enable us to assert that ship
building is one of the oldest of human industries, and that
there probably existed a sea borne commerce in the Mediterranean
long before the building of the Pyramids.</p>

<p>Though the Ph&oelig;nicians were the principal maritime people
of antiquity in the Mediterranean, we know next to nothing of
their vessels. The same may be said of the Greeks of the
Archaic period. There is, however, ground for hope that,
with the progress of research, more may be discovered concerning
the earliest types of Greek vessels; for example, during
the past year, a vase of about the eighth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> was
found, and on it is a representation of a bireme of the Archaic
period of quite exceptional interest. As the greater part of
this handbook was already in type when the vase was acquired
by the British Museum, it has only been possible to reproduce
the representation in the Appendix. The drawings of Greek
merchant-ships and galleys on sixth and fifth-century vases
are merely pictures, which tell us but little that we really want
to know. If it had not been for the discovery, this century,
that a drain at the Pir&aelig;us was partly constructed of marble
slabs, on which were engraved the inventories of the Athenian
dockyards, we should know but little of the Greek triremes of
as late a period as the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> We do not possess
a single illustration of a Greek or Roman trireme, excepting
only a small one from Trajan's Column, which must not be
taken too seriously, as it is obviously pictorial, and was made
a century and a half after many-banked ships had gone out
of fashion.</p>

<p>In the first eight centuries of our era records and illustrations
of ships continue to be extremely meagre. Owing to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix-x" id="Page_ix-x">ix-x</a></span>
comparatively recent discovery we know something of
Scandinavian boats. When we consider the way in which the
Norsemen overran the seaboard of Europe, it seems probable
that their types of vessels were dominant, at any rate in
Northern and Western European waters, from the tenth to
the twelfth century. From the time of the Norman Conquest
down to the reign of Henry VIII. we have to rely, for
information about ships, upon occasional notes by the
old chroniclers, helped out by a few illustrations taken from
ancient corporate seals and from manuscripts. From the
time of Henry VIII., onwards, information about warships
is much more abundant; but, unfortunately, little is known
of the merchant vessels of the Tudor, Stuart, and early
Hanoverian periods, and it has not been found possible to
trace the origin and development of the various types of
merchant sailing-ships now in existence.</p>

<p>The names of the authorities consulted have generally been
given in the text, or in footnotes. The author is indebted to
Dr. Warre's article on ships, in the last edition of the
"Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica," and to Mr. Cecil Torr's work,
"Ancient Ships," for much information concerning Greek
and Roman galleys, and further to "The Royal Navy," a
history by Mr. W. Laird Clowes, and the "History of Marine
Architecture" by Charnock, for much relating to British
warships down to the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<h4><i>WOODEN SAILING-SHIPS.</i></h4>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>INTRODUCTION.</h5>


<p>A museum relating to Naval Architecture and Shipbuilding
is of the utmost interest to the people of Great Britain, on
account of the importance to them of everything that bears
on the carrying of their commerce. Every Englishman knows,
in a general way, that the commerce of the British Empire is
more extensive than that of any other state in the world, and
that the British sea-going mercantile marine compares favourably
in point of size even with that of all the other countries
of the world put together; but few are probably aware of the
immense importance to us of these fleets of trading ships, and
of the great part which they play in the maintenance of the
prosperity of these isles. The shipping industry ranks, after
agriculture, as the largest of our national commercial pursuits.
There is more capital locked up in it, and more hands are
employed in the navigation and construction of ships, their
engines and fittings, than in any other trade of the country
excepting the tillage of the soil.</p>

<p>The following Table gives the relative figures of the merchant
navies of the principal states of the civilised world in the
year 1898, and proves at a glance the immense interest to
our fellow countrymen of all that affects the technical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
advancement of the various industries connected with
shipping:&nbsp;&mdash;</p>

<p>The part played by technical improvements in the maintenance
of our present position cannot be over-estimated; for that
position, such as it is, is not due to any inherent permanent
advantages possessed by this country. Time was when
our mercantile marine was severely threatened by competition
from foreign states. To quote the most recent example, about
the middle of last century the United States of America fought
a well-contested struggle with us for the carrying trade of the
world. Shortly after the abolition of the navigation laws, the
competition was very severe, and United States ships had
obtained almost exclusive possession of the China trade, and of
the trade between Europe and North America, and in the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
1850 the total tonnage of the shipping of the States was
3,535,434, against 4,232,960 tons owned by Great Britain.
The extraordinary progress in American mercantile shipbuilding
was due, in part, to special circumstances connected
with their navigation laws, and in part to the abundance and
cheapness of excellent timber; but, even with these advantages,
the Americans would never have been able to run
such a close race with us for the carrying trade of the
world, had it not been for the great technical skill and intelligence
of their shipbuilders, who produced vessels which were
the envy and admiration of our own constructors. As a
proof of this statement, it may be mentioned that, the labour-saving
mechanical contrivances adopted by the Americans
were such that, on board their famous liners and clippers,
twenty men could do the work which in a British ship of equal
size required thirty, and, in addition to this advantage, the
American vessels could sail faster and carry more cargo in
proportion to their registered tonnage than our own vessels.
It was not till new life was infused into British naval architecture
that we were enabled to conquer the American competition;
and then it was only by producing still better
examples of the very class of ship which the Americans had
been the means of introducing, that we were eventually enabled
to wrest from them the China trade. Another triumph in the
domain of technical shipbuilding, viz., the introduction and
successful development of the iron-screw merchant steamer,
eventually secured for the people of this country that dominion
of the seas which remains with them to this day.</p>

<p>Among the great means of advancing technical improvements,
none takes higher rank than a good educational
museum; for it enables the student to learn, as he otherwise
cannot learn, the general course which improvements have
taken since the earliest times, and hence to appreciate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
direction which progress will inevitably take in the future.
Here he will learn, for instance, how difficulties have been
overcome in the past, and will be the better prepared to play
his part in overcoming those with which he, in his turn, will be
confronted. In such a museum he can study the advantages
conferred upon the owner, by the successive changes which
have been effected in the materials, construction, and the
means of propulsion of ships. He can trace, for instance, the
effects of the change from wood to iron, and from iron to
steel, in the carrying capacity of ships, and he can note the
effects of successive improvements in the propelling machinery
in saving weight and space occupied by engines, boilers, and
bunkers; and in conferring upon a ship of a given size the
power of making longer voyages. Here, too, he can learn
how it was that the American clipper supplanted the old
English sailing merchantman, and how the screw iron ship,
fitted with highly economical engines, has practically driven
the clipper from the seas. In fact, with the aid of a good
museum the student is enabled to take a bird's-eye view of the
whole chain of progress, in which the existing state of things
constitutes but a link.</p>

<p>Signs are not wanting that the competition with which
British shipowners had to contend in the past will again become
active in the near future. The advantages conferred upon us
by abundant supplies of iron and by cheap labour will not last
for ever. There are many who expect, not without reason,
that the abolition or even the diminution of protection in the
United States will, when it comes to pass, have the same
stimulating effect upon the American shipbuilding industry
which the abolition of the old navigation laws had upon our
own; and when that day comes Englishmen will find it an
advantage to be able to enter the contest equipped with the
best attainable technical education and experience.</p>

<h5>ANCIENT SHIPS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND RED SEAS.</h5>


<p>It is not difficult to imagine how mankind first conceived
the idea of making use of floating structures to enable him to
traverse stretches of water. The trunk of a tree floating down
a river may have given him his first notions. He would not be
long in discovering that the tree could support more than its
own weight without sinking. From the single trunk to a raft,
formed of several stems lashed together, the step would not be
a long one. Similarly, once it was noticed that a trunk, or log,
could carry more than its own weight and float, the idea would
naturally soon occur to any one to diminish the inherent weight
of the log by hollowing it out and thus increase its carrying
capacity; the subsequent improvements of shaping the underwater
portion so as to make the elementary boat handy, and to
diminish its resistance in the water, and of fitting up the
interior so as to give facilities for navigating the vessel and for
accommodating in it human beings and goods, would all come
by degrees with experience. Even to the present day beautiful
specimens exist of such boats, or canoes, admirably formed
out of hollowed tree-trunks. They are made by many
uncivilized peoples, such as the islanders of the Pacific and
some of the tribes of Central Africa. Probably the earliest
type of <i>built-up</i> boat was made by stretching skins on a frame.
To this class belonged the coracle of the Ancient Britons, which
is even now in common use on the Atlantic seaboard of Ireland.
The transition from a raft to a flat-bottomed boat was a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
obvious improvement, and such vessels were probably the
immediate forerunners of ships.</p>

<p>It is usual to refer to Noah's ark as the oldest ship of which
there is any authentic record. Since, however, Egypt has been
systematically explored, pictures of vessels have been discovered
immensely older than the ark&mdash;that is to say, if the
date usually assigned to the latter (2840 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> ) can be accepted
as approximately correct; and, as we shall see hereafter (p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>),
there are vessels <i>now in existence in Egypt which were built</i>
about this very period. The ark was a vessel of such enormous
size that the mere fact that it was constructed argues a very
advanced knowledge and experience on the part of the contemporaries
of Noah. Its dimensions were, according to the
biblical version, reckoning the cubit at eighteen inches;
length, 450 feet; breadth, 75 feet; and depth, 45 feet. If
very full in form its "registered tonnage" would have been
nearly 15,000. According to the earlier Babylonian version,
the depth was equal to the breadth, but, unfortunately, the
figures of the measurements are not legible.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes suggested that the ark was a huge raft
with a superstructure, or house, built on it, of the dimensions
given above. There does not, however, appear to be the
slightest reason for concurring with this suggestion. On the
contrary, the biblical account of the structure of the ark is so
detailed, that we have no right to suppose that the description
of the most important part of it, the supposed raft, to which
its power of floating would have been due, would have been
omitted. Moreover, the whole account reads like the description
of a ship-shaped structure.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Shipbuilding in Egypt.</span></h4>

<p>The earliest information on the building of ships is found,
as might be expected, on the Egyptian tombs and monuments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
It is probable that the valley of the Nile was also the first land
bordering on the Mediterranean in which ships, as distinguished
from more elementary craft, were constructed.
Everything is in favour of such a supposition. In the first
place, the country was admirably situated, geographically, for
the encouragement of the art of navigation, having seaboards
on two important inland seas which commanded the commerce
of Europe and Asia. In the next place, the habitable portion
of Egypt consisted of a long narrow strip of densely peopled,
fertile territory, bordering a great navigable river, which
formed a magnificent highway throughout the whole extent
of the country. It is impossible to conceive of physical
circumstances more conducive to the discovery and development
of the arts of building and navigating floating structures.
The experience gained on the safe waters of the Nile would
be the best preparation for taking the bolder step of venturing
on the open seas. The character of the two inland seas
which form the northern and eastern frontiers of Egypt was
such as to favour, to the greatest extent, the spirit of adventure.
As a rule, their waters are relatively calm, and the distances
to be traversed to reach other lands are inconsiderable.
We know that the ancient Egyptians, at a period which the
most modern authorities place at about 7,000 years ago, had
already attained to a very remarkable degree of civilisation and
to a knowledge of the arts of construction on land which has
never since been excelled. What is more natural than to
suppose that the genius and science which enabled them to
build the Pyramids and their vast temples and palaces, to construct
huge works for the regulation of the Nile, and to quarry,
work into shape, and move into place blocks of granite weighing
in some cases several hundreds of tons, should also lead
them to excel in the art of building ships? Not only the
physical circumstances, but the habits and the religion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
people created a demand, even a necessity, for the existence of
navigable floating structures. At the head of the delta of the
Nile was the ancient capital, the famous city of Memphis, near
to which were built the Pyramids, as tombs in which might be
preserved inviolate until the day of resurrection, the embalmed
bodies of their kings. The roofs of the burial chambers
in the heart of the Pyramids were prevented from falling in,
under the great weight of the superincumbent mass, by huge
blocks, or beams, of the hardest granite, meeting at an angle
above the chambers. The long galleries by which the chambers
were approached were closed after the burial by enormous gates,
consisting of blocks of granite, which were let down from
above, sliding in grooves like the portcullis of a feudal castle.
In this way it was hoped to preserve the corpse contained in
the chamber absolutely inviolate. The huge blocks of granite,
which weighed from 50 to 60 tons each, were supposed to be
too heavy ever to be moved again after they had been once
lowered into position, and they were so hard that it was
believed they could never be pierced. Now, even if we had
no other evidence to guide us, the existence of these blocks
of granite in the Pyramids would afford the strongest
presumption that the Egyptians of that remote time were
perfectly familiar with the arts of inland navigation, for the
stone was quarried at Assouan, close to the first cataract, 583
miles above Cairo, and could only have been conveyed from
the quarry to the building site by water.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Memphis are hundreds of other
blocks of granite from Assouan, many of them of enormous size.
The Pyramid of Men-kau-Ra, or Mycerinus, built about
3633 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, was once entirely encased with blocks from Assouan.
The Temple of the Sphinx, built at a still earlier date, was
formed, to a large extent, of huge pieces of the same material,
each measuring 15 &times; 5 &times; 3&middot;2 feet, and weighing about 18<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
tons. The mausoleum of the sacred bulls at Sakara contains
numbers of Assouan granite sarcophagi, some of which
measure 13 &times; 8 &times; 11 feet. These are but a few instances, out
of the many existing, from which we may infer that, even so
far back as the fourth dynasty, the Egyptians made use of the
arts of inland navigation. We are, however, fortunately not
obliged to rely on inference, for we have direct evidence from
the sculptures and records on the ancient tombs. Thanks to
these, we now know what the ancient Nile boats were like, and
how they were propelled, and what means were adopted for
transporting the huge masses of building material which were
used in the construction of the temples and monuments.</p>

<p>The art of reading the hieroglyphic inscriptions was first
discovered about the year 1820, and the exploration of the
tombs and monuments has only been prosecuted systematically
during the last five-and-twenty years. Most of the
knowledge of ancient Egyptian ships has, therefore, been
acquired in quite recent times, and much of it only during
the last year or two. This is the reason why, in the old works
on shipbuilding, no information is given on this most interesting
subject. Knowledge is, however, now being increased
every day, and, thanks to the practice of the ancient Egyptians
of recording their achievements in sculpture in a material
which is imperishable in a dry climate, we possess at the
present day, probably, a more accurate knowledge of their
ships than we do of those of any other ancient or medi&aelig;val
people.</p>

<p>By far the oldest boats of which anything is now known were
built in Egypt by the people who inhabited that country before
the advent of the Pyramid-builders. It is only within the last
few years that these tombs have been explored and critically
examined. They are now supposed to be of Libyan origin and
to date from between 5000 and 6000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> In many of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
tombs vases of pottery have been discovered, on which are
painted rude representations of ships. Some of the latter were
of remarkable size and character. Fig. <a href="#f2">2</a> is taken from one of
these vases. It is a river scene, showing two boats in procession.
The pyramid-shaped mounds in the background represent a
row of hills. These boats are evidently of very large size.
One of them has 58 oars, or more probably paddles, on each
side, and two large cabins amidships, connected by a flying
bridge, and with spaces fenced off from the body of the vessel.
The steering was, apparently, effected by means of three large
paddles on each side, and from the prow of one of the boats
hangs a weight, which was probably intended for an anchor.
It will be noticed that the two ends of these vessels, like the
Nile boats of the Egyptians proper, were not waterborne. A
great many representations of these boats have now been
discovered. They all have the same leading characteristics,
though they differ very much in size. Amongst other peculiarities
they invariably have an object at the prow resembling
two branches of palm issuing from a stalk, and also a mast
carrying an ensign at the after-cabin.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;The oldest known ships. Between 5000 and 6000&nbsp;<span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p></div>

<p>Some explorers are of opinion that these illustrations do not
represent boats, but fortifications, or stockades of some sort.
If we relied only on the rude representations painted on the
vases, the question might be a moot one. It has, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
been definitely set at rest by Professor Flinders Petrie, who,
in the year 1899, brought back from Egypt very large drawings
of the same character, taken, not from vases, but from the
tombs themselves. The drawings clearly show that the
objects are boats, and that they were apparently very shallow
and flat-bottomed. It is considered probable that they were
employed in over-sea trade as well as for Nile traffic; for, in
the same tombs were found specimens of pottery of foreign
manufacture, some of which have been traced to Bosnia.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Egyptian boat of the time of the third dynasty.</p></div>

<p>The most ancient mention of a ship in the world's history
is to be found in the name of the eighth king of Egypt after
Mena, the founder of the royal race. This king, who was at the
head of the second dynasty, was called Betou (Bo&euml;thos in
Greek), which word signifies the "prow of a ship." Nineteen
kings intervened between him and Khufu (Cheops), the
builder of the Great Pyramid at Ghizeh. The date of this
pyramid is given by various authorities as from about 4235
to 3500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> As the knowledge of Egyptology increases the
date is set further and further back, and the late Mariette
Pasha, who was one of the greatest authorities on the subject,
fixed it at 4235 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> About five centuries intervened between
the reign of Betou and the date of the Great Pyramid. Hence
we can infer that ships were known to the Egyptians of the
dynasties sixty-seven centuries ago.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, we are not obliged to rely on inferences
drawn from the name of an individual; we actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
possess pictures of vessels which, there is every reason to
believe, were built before the date of the Great Pyramid.</p>

<p>The boat represented by Fig. <a href="#f3">3</a> is of great interest, as it is by
far the oldest specimen of a true Egyptian boat that has yet
been discovered. It was copied by the late Mr. Villiers Stuart
from the tomb of Ka Khont Khut, situated in the side of a
mountain near K&acirc;u-el-Keb&icirc;r, on the right bank of the Nile,
about 279 miles above Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The tomb belongs to a very
remote period. From a study of the hieroglyphs, the names
of the persons, the forms of the pottery found, and the shape,
arrangement, and decoration of the tomb, Mr. Villiers Stuart
came to the conclusion that it dates from the third dynasty,
and that, consequently, it is older than the Great Pyramid at
Ghizeh. If these conclusions are correct, and if Mariette's
date for the Great Pyramid be accepted, Fig. <a href="#f3">3</a> represents a
Nile boat as used about 6,300 years ago&mdash;that is to say, about
fifteen centuries before the date commonly accepted for the
ark. Mr. Villiers Stuart supposes that it was a dug-out
canoe, but from the dimensions of the boat this theory is
hardly tenable. It will be noted that there are seven paddlers
on each side, in addition to a man using a sounding, or else a
punt, pole at the prow, and three men steering with paddles in
the stern, while amidships there is a considerable free space,
occupied only by the owner, who is armed with a whip, or courbash.
The paddlers occupy almost exactly one-half of the
total length, and from the space required for each of them the
boat must have been quite 56 feet long. It could hardly have
been less than seven feet wide, as it contained a central cabin,
with sufficient space on either side of the latter for paddlers to
sit. If it were a "dug-out," the tree from which it was
made must have been brought down the river from tropical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>Africa. There is no reason, however, to suppose anything of
the sort; for, if the epoch produced workmen skilful enough
to excavate and decorate the tomb, and to carve the statues
and make the pottery which it contained, it must also have
produced men quite capable of building up a boat from planks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f4" id="f4"></a>
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="500" height="330"
alt="Frontispiece." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Egyptian boat of the time of the fourth dynasty.</p></div>

<p>The use of sails was also understood at this remote epoch, for
it will be noticed that, on the roof of the cabin is lying a mast
which has been unshipped. The mast is triangular in shape,
consisting of two spars, joined together at the top at an acute
angle, and braced together lower down. This form was
probably adopted in order to dispense with stays, and thus
facilitate shipping and unshipping. It is also worthy of note
that this boat appears to have been decked over, as the feet
of all those on board are visible above the gunwale. A representation
of a very similar boat was found in the tomb of
Mer&acirc;b, a son of Khufu, of the fourth dynasty.</p>

<p>The tombs of Egypt abound in pictures of boats and larger
vessels, and many wooden models of them have also been found
in the sarcophagi. There is in the Berlin Museum a model of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
a boat similar in general arrangement to the one just described.
It is decked over and provided with a cabin amidships, which
does not occupy the full width of the vessel. Fig. <a href="#f4">4</a> is a vessel
of later date and larger size than that found in the tomb of
Ka Khont Khut, but its general characteristics are similar.
From the number of paddlers it must have been at least 100
feet in length. In this case we see the mast is erected and a
square sail set. The bow and stern also come much higher out
of the water. The roof of the cabin is prolonged aft, so as to
form a shelter for the steersman and a seat for the man holding
the ropes. Similarly it is prolonged forward, so as to provide
a shelter for the captain, or owner. The method of steering
with oars continued in use for centuries; but in later and
larger vessels the steering-oars, which were of great size, were
worked by a mechanical arrangement. The illustration was
taken originally from a fourth-dynasty tomb at K&ocirc;m-el-Ahmars.</p>

<p>There are also extant pictures of Egyptian cattle-boats,
formed of two ordinary barges lashed together, with a temporary
house, or cattle-shed, constructed across them. The
history of Egypt, as inscribed in hieroglyphs on the ancient
monuments, relates many instances of huge sarcophagi,
statues, and obelisks having been brought down the Nile on
ships. The tombs and monuments of the sixth dynasty are
particularly rich in such records. In the tomb of Una, who
was a high officer under the three kings, Ati, Pepi I., and
Mer-en-Ra, are inscriptions which shed a flood of light on
Egyptian shipbuilding of this period, and on the uses to which
ships were put. In one of them we learn how Una was sent by
Pepi to quarry a sarcophagus in a single piece of limestone,
in the mountain of Jurra, opposite to Memphis, and to transport
it, together with other stones, in one of the king's ships.
In another it is related how he headed a military expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
against the land of Zerehbah, "to the north of the land of the
Hirusha," and how the army was embarked in ships.</p>

<p>In the reign of Pepi's successor, Mer-en-Ra, Una appears to
have been charged with the quarrying and transport of the
stones destined for the king's pyramid, his sarcophagus, statue,
and other purposes. The following passage from the inscriptions
on his tomb gives even the number of the ships and rafts
which he employed on this work:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"His Holiness, the King Mer-en-Ra, sent me to the country of
Abhat to bring back a sarcophagus with its cover, also a small pyramid,
and a statue of the King Mer-en-Ra, whose pyramid is called
Kha-nofer ('the beautiful rising'). And his Holiness sent me to the
city of Elephantine to bring back a holy shrine, with its base of hard
granite, and the doorposts and cornices of the same granite, and also
to bring back the granite posts and thresholds for the temple opposite
to the pyramid Kha-nofer, of King Mer-en-Ra. The number of ships
destined for the complete transport of all these stones consisted of six
broad vessels, three tow-boats, three rafts, and one ship manned with
warriors."</p></div>

<p>Further on, the inscriptions relate how stone for the Pyramid
was hewn in the granite quarries at Assouan, and how rafts
were constructed, 60 cubits in length and 30 cubits in breadth,
to transport the material. The Royal Egyptian cubit was
20&middot;67 inches in length, and the common cubit 18&middot;24 inches.
The river had fallen to such an extent that it was not possible
to make use of these rafts, and others of a smaller size had to
be constructed. For this purpose Una was despatched up the
river to the country of Wawa-t, which Brugsch considered to
be the modern Korosko. The inscription states&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"His Holiness sent me to cut down four forests in the South, in
order to build three large vessels and four towing-vessels out of the
acacia wood in the country of Wawa-t. And behold the officials of
Araret, Aam, and Mata caused the wood to be cut down for this purpose.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>I executed all this in the space of a year. As soon as the waters rose
I loaded the rafts with immense pieces of granite for the Pyramid
Kha-nofer, of the King Mer-en-Ra."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Villiers Stuart found several pictures of large ships of this
remote period at Kasr-el-Syad on the Nile, about 70 miles
below Thebes, in the tomb of Ta-Hotep, who lived in the
reigns of Pepi I. and his two successors. These boats were
manned with twenty-four rowers, and had two cabins, one
amidships and the other astern.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The same explorer describes
the contents of a tomb of the sixth dynasty at Gebel Ab&ucirc;
Faida, on the walls of which he observed the painting of a
boat with a triple mast (presumably made of three spars
arranged like the edges of a triangular pyramid), and a stern
projecting beneath the water.</p>

<p>Between the sixth and the eleventh dynasties Egyptian
history is almost an utter blank. The monuments contain no
records for a period of about 600 years. We are, therefore, in
complete ignorance of the progress of shipbuilding during
this epoch. It was, however, probably considerable; for, when
next the monuments speak it is to give an account of a mercantile
expedition on the high seas. In the Valley of Ham&acirc;m&acirc;t,
near Coptos, about 420 miles above Cairo, is an inscription on
the rocks, dating from the reign of Sankh-ka-Ra, the last king
of the eleventh dynasty (about 2800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> ), describing an
expedition by sea to the famous land of Punt, on the coast of
the Red Sea. This expedition is not to be confounded with
another, a much more famous one, to the same land, carried
out by direction of Queen Hatshepsu of the eighteenth dynasty,
about eleven centuries later. Sankh-ka-Ra's enterprise is,
however, remarkable as being the first over-sea maritime
expedition recorded in the world's history. It may be noted that
it took place at about the date usually assigned to Noah's ark.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>
<p>The town of Coptos was of considerable commercial importance,
having been at one end of the great desert route from
the Nile to the Red Sea port of Kosseir, whence most of the
Egyptian maritime expeditions started. The land of Punt,
which was the objective of the expedition, is now considered
to be identical with Somaliland. The following extracts from
the inscription give an excellent idea of the objects and conduct
of the expedition, which was under the leadership of a noble
named Hannu, who was himself the author of the inscription:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was sent to conduct ships to the land of Punt, to fetch for
Pharaoh sweet-smelling spices, which the princes of the red land
collect out of fear and dread, such as he inspires in all nations. And I
started from the City of Coptos, and his Holiness gave the command
that the armed men, who were to accompany me, should be from the
south country of the Theba&icirc;d."</p></div>

<p>After describing the arrangements which he made for
watering the expedition along the desert route, he goes on
to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then I arrived at the port Seba, and I had ships of burthen built
to bring back products of all kinds. And I offered a great sacrifice
of oxen, cows, and goats. And when I returned from Seba I had
executed the King's command, for I brought him back all kinds of
products which I had met with in the ports of the Holy Land (Punt).
And I came back by the road of Uak and Rohan, and brought with
me precious stones for the statues of the temples. But such a thing
never happened since there were kings; nor was the like of it ever
done by any blood relations who were sent to these places since the
time (of the reign) of the Sun-god Ra."</p></div>

<p>From the last sentence of the above quotation we may infer
that previous expeditions had been sent to the land of Punt.
Communication with this region must, however, have been
carried on only at considerable intervals, for we read that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>Hannu had to build the ships required for the voyage. Unfortunately,
no representations of these vessels accompany the
inscription.</p>

<p>Between the end of the eleventh and the commencement of
the eighteenth dynasty, the monuments give us very little
information about ships or maritime expeditions. Aahmes,
the first king of the latter dynasty, freed Egypt from the
domination of the Shepherd Kings by means of a naval expedition
on the Nile and the Mediterranean. A short history of
this campaign is given in the tomb of another Aahmes, near
El Kab, a place on the east bank of the river, 502 miles south
of Cairo. This Aahmes was a captain of sailors who served
under Sequenen-Ra, King Aahmes, Amenophis I., and
Thotmes I. King Aahmes is supposed to have been the
Pharaoh of the Old Testament who knew not Joseph. He
lived about 1700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> </p>

<p>By far the most interesting naval records of this dynasty are
the accounts, in the temple of D&ecirc;r-el-Bahari close to Thebes, of
the famous expedition to the land of Punt, carried out by order
of that remarkable woman Queen Hatshepsu, who was the
daughter of Thotmes I., half-sister and wife of Thotmes II., and
aunt and step-mother of the famous king Thotmes III. She
appears to have been called by her father during his lifetime to
share the throne with him, and to have practically usurped the
government during the reign of her husband and during the
early years of the reign of her nephew.</p>

<p>The expedition to the land of Punt was evidently one of
the most remarkable events of her reign. It took place about
1600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> &mdash;that is to say, about three centuries before the
Exodus. The history of the undertaking is given at great
length on the retaining wall of one of the terraces of the temple,
and the various scenes and events are illustrated by carvings on
the same wall, in as complete a manner as though the expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
had taken place in the present time, and had been accompanied
by the artists of one of our pictorial newspapers.
Fortunately, the great bulk of the carvings and inscriptions
remain to this day, and we possess, therefore, a unique record
of a trading expedition carried out at this remote period.</p>

<p>The carvings comprise representations of the ships going out.
The landing at the "incense terraced-mountain," and the
meeting with the princes and people of this strange land, are
also shown. We have pictures of their pile dwellings, and of
the trees and animals of the country, and also portraits of the
King of Punt, of his wife and children. Lastly, we have
representations of the ships returning to Egypt, laden with
the precious incense of the land and with other merchandise,
and also of the triumphant reception of the members of the
expedition at Thebes.</p>

<p>One of the inscriptions relates as follows:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ships were laden to the uttermost with the wonderful products
of the land of Punt, and with the different precious woods of the divine
land, and with heaps of the resin of incense, with fresh incense trees,
with ebony, (objects) of ivory set in pure gold from the land of the
'Amu, with sweet woods, Khesit-wood, with Ahem incense, holy resin,
and paint for the eyes, with dog-headed apes, with long-tailed monkeys
and greyhounds, with leopard-skins, and with natives of the country,
together with their children. Never was the like brought to any king
(of Egypt) since the world stands."</p></div>

<p>The boast contained in the concluding sentence was obviously
not justified, as we know the same claims were made in
the inscription in the valley of Hammam&acirc;t, describing the
previous expedition to Punt, which took place eleven centuries
earlier.</p>

<p>From the frontispiece, Fig. <a href="#f1">1</a>, we can form an accurate idea
of the ships used in the Red Sea trade in the time of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>eighteenth dynasty. They were propelled
by rowers instead of by paddlers,
as in all the previous examples. There
were fifteen rowers on each side, and,
allowing four feet for the distance
between each seat, and taking account
of the length of the overhanging
portions at bow and stern, the length
of each vessel could have been little
short of a hundred feet. They were
apparently decked over and provided
with raised cabins at the two extremities.
The projections marked along
the sides may indicate the ends of
beams, or they may, as some writers
have supposed, have been pieces of
timber against which the oars could be
worked in narrow and shallow water.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Nile barge carrying obelisks. About 1600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> </p></div>

<p>These vessels were each rigged with
a huge square sail. The spars carrying
the sail were as long as the boats themselves,
and were each formed of two
pieces spliced together in the middle.
The stems and sterns were not waterborne.
In order to prevent the vessel
from hogging under the influence of
the weights of the unsupported ends,
a truss was employed, similar in
principle and object to those used
to this day in American river
steamers. The truss was formed by
erecting four or more pillars in the body
of the vessel, terminating at a height<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of about six feet above the gunwale, in crutches. A strong
rope running fore and aft was passed over these crutches and
also round the mast, the two ends of the rope having been so
arranged as to gird and support the stem and stern respectively.</p>

<p>The Temple of D&ecirc;r-el-Bahari contained also a most interesting
illustrated account of the transport of two great obelisks
down the Nile in the reign of the same queen. Unfortunately,
parts of the description and of the carvings have been lost,
but enough remains to give us a very clear idea of the vessels
employed and of the method of transport. Fig. <a href="#f5">5</a> shows the
type of barge employed to carry the obelisks, of which there
were two. The dotted lines show the portions of the carving
which are at present missing. The restoration was effected
by Monsieur Edouard Naville.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The restoration is by no means
conjectural. The key to it was furnished by a hieroglyph in
the form of the barge with the obelisks on deck. Some of these
obelisks were of very large size. There are two, which were
hewn out of granite for Queen Hatshepsu, still at the Temple
of Karnak. They may, very possibly, be the two which are
referred to in the description at D&ecirc;r-el-Bahari. One of them
is 98 feet and the other 105 feet in height. The larger of the
two has been calculated to weigh 374 tons, and the two
together may have weighed over 700 tons. To transport such
heavy stones very large barges would have been required.
Unfortunately, the greater portion of the inscription describing
the building of these boats has been lost, but what
remains states that orders were given to collect "sycamores
from the whole land (to do the) work of building a very great
boat." There is, however, an inscription still intact in the
tomb of an ancient Egyptian named Anna, who lived in the
reigns of the three kings Thotmes (and therefore also during
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>that of Queen Hatshepsu), which relates that, having to
transport two obelisks for Thotmes I., he built a boat 120 cubits
long and 40 cubits wide. If the royal cubit of 20&middot;72 inches
was referred to, the dimensions of the boat would have been
200 feet long by 69 feet wide. This is possibly the very boat
illustrated on the walls of D&ecirc;r-el-Bahari; for, it having
evidently been a matter of some difficulty to collect the timber
necessary to build so large a vessel, it seems only natural to
suppose that it would be carefully preserved for the future
transport of similar obelisks. If, however, it was found
necessary to construct a new boat in order to transport Queen
Hatshepsu's obelisks, we may be fairly certain that it was
larger than the one whose dimensions are given above, for the
taller of her two obelisks at Karnak is the largest that has been
found in Egypt in modern times. The obelisk of rose granite of
Thotmes I., still at Karnak, is 35 feet shorter, being 70 feet, or
exactly the same height as the one called Cleopatra's Needle,
now on the Thames Embankment.</p>

<p>The barge shown in Fig. <a href="#f5">5</a> was strengthened, apparently,
with three tiers of beams; it was steered by two pairs of huge
steering-oars, and was towed by three parallel groups, each
consisting of ten large boats. There were 32 oarsmen to each
boat in the two wing groups, and 36 in each of the central
groups: there were, therefore, exactly one thousand oars used
in all. The towing-cable started from the masthead of the
foremost boat of each group, and thence passed to the bow of
the second one, and so on, the stern of each boat being left
perfectly free, for the purpose, no doubt, of facilitating the
steering. The flotilla was accompanied by five smaller boats,
some of which were used by the priests, while the others were
despatch vessels, probably used to keep up communications
with the groups of tugs.</p>

<p>There are no other inscriptions, or carvings, that have as yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
been discovered in Egypt which give us so much information
regarding Egyptian ships as those on the Temple at D&ecirc;r-el-Bahari.
From time to time we read of naval and mercantile
expeditions, but illustrations of the ships and details of the
voyages are, as a rule, wanting. We know that Seti I., of the
nineteenth dynasty, whose reign commenced about 1366 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
was a great encourager of commerce. He felled timber in
Lebanon for building ships, and is said to have excavated a
canal between the Nile and the Red Sea. His successor, the
famous Ramses II., carried on wars by sea, as is proved by the
inscriptions in the Temple at Ab&ucirc; Simbel in Nubia, 762 miles
above Cairo.</p>

<p>In the records of the reign of Ramses III., 1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, we
again come upon illustrations of ships in the Temple of Victory
at Med&icirc;net Hab&ucirc;, West Thebes. The inscriptions describe a
great naval victory which this king won at Migdol, near the
Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, over northern invaders, probably
Colchians and Carians. Fig. <a href="#f6">6</a> shows one of the battleships.
It is probably more a symbolical than an exact representation,
nevertheless it gives us some valuable information. For
instance, we see that the rowers were protected against the
missiles of their adversaries by strong bulwarks, and the
captain occupied a crow's nest at the masthead.</p>

<p>Ramses III. did a great deal to develop Egyptian commerce.
His naval activities were by no means confined to the Mediterranean,
for we read that he built a fleet at Suez, and traded
with the land of Punt and the shores of the Indian Ocean.
Herodotus states that, in his day, the docks still existed at the
head of the Arabian Gulf where this Red Sea fleet was built.</p>

<p>Pharaoh Nekau (Necho), who reigned from 612 to 596 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and who defeated Josiah, King of Judah, was one of the kings
of Egypt who did most to encourage commerce. He commenced
a canal to join the Pelusiac branch of the Nile at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Bubastis with the Red Sea, but never finished it. It was under
his directions that the Ph&oelig;nicians, according to Herodotus,
made the voyage round Africa referred to on p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>. When
Nekau abandoned the construction of the canal he built two
fleets of triremes, one for use in the Mediterranean, and the
other for the Red Sea. The latter fleet was built in the
Arabian Gulf.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f6" id="f6"></a><img src="images/fig6.png" width="500" height="301"
alt="Frontispiece." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Battleship of Ramses III. About 1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> </p></div>

<p>In later times the seaborne commerce of Egypt fell, to a
large extent, into the hands of the Ph&oelig;nicians and Greeks.</p>

<p>Herodotus (484 to 423 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> ) gives an interesting account of
the Nile boats of his day, and of the method of navigation of
the river.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Their boats, with which they carry cargoes, are made of the thorny
acacia.... From this tree they cut pieces of wood about two cubits
in length, and arrange them like bricks, fastening the boat together
by a great number of long bolts through the two-cubit pieces; and
when they have thus fastened the boat together they lay cross-pieces
over the top, using no ribs for the sides; and within they caulk the
seams with papyrus. They make one steering-oar for it, which is
passed through the bottom of the boat, and they have a mast of acacia
and sails of papyrus.  These boats cannot sail up the river unless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>there be a very fresh wind blowing, but are towed.... Down stream
they travel as follows: they have a door-shaped crate, made of
tamarisk wood and reed mats sewn together, and also a stone of about
two talents' weight, bored with a hole; and of these the boatman lets
the crate float on in front of the boat, fastened with a rope, and the
stone drag behind by another rope. The crate then, as the force of
the stream presses upon it, goes on swiftly and draws on the ... boats,
... while the stone, dragging after it behind and sunk deep in the
water, keeps its course straight."</p></div>

<p>In connection with this account it is curious to note that, at
so late a period as the time of Herodotus, papyrus was used for
the sails of Nile boats, for we know that, for many centuries
previously, the Egyptians were adepts in the manufacture of
linen, and actually exported fine linen to Cyprus to be used as
sail-cloth.</p>

<p>Before concluding this account of shipbuilding in ancient
Egypt, it may be mentioned that, in the year 1894, the French
Egyptologist, Monsieur J. de Morgan, discovered several Nile
boats of the time of the twelfth dynasty (2850 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> ) admirably
preserved in brick vaults at Dash&ucirc;r, a little above Cairo, on the
left bank of the river. The site of these vaults is about one
hour's ride from the river and between 70 and 80 feet above
the plain. The boats are about 33 feet long, 7 to 8 feet wide,
and 2&frac12; to 3 feet deep. As there were neither rowlocks nor
masts, and as they were found in close proximity to some
Royal tombs, it is considered probable that they were funeral
boats, used for carrying royal mummies across the river.
They are constructed of planks of acacia and sycamore, about
three inches thick, which are dovetailed together and fastened
with trenails. There are floors, but no ribs. In this respect
the account of Herodotus is remarkably confirmed. The
method of construction was so satisfactory that, although they
are nearly 5,000 years old, they held rigidly together after their
supports had been removed by Monsieur de Morgan. They
were steered by two large paddles. The discovery of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
boats is of extraordinary interest, for they were built at the
period usually assigned to Noah's ark. It is a curious fact
that they should have been found so far from the river, but we
know from other sources&mdash;such as the paintings found in
papyrus books&mdash;that it was the custom of the people to
transport the mummies of royal personages, together with the
funeral boats, on sledges to the tomb.</p>

<p>The famous galleys of the Egypt of the Ptolemies belonged
to the period of Greek and Roman naval architecture, and
will be referred to later.</p>

<p>From the time of the ancient Egyptian vessels there is no
record whatever of the progress of naval architecture till we
come to the period of the Greeks, and even the early records
relating to this country are meagre in the extreme. The
Ph&oelig;nicians were among the first of the races who dwelt on the
Mediterranean seaboard to cultivate a seaborne commerce,
and to them, after the Egyptians, is undoubtedly due the early
progress made in sea-going ships. This remarkable people is
said to have originally come to the Levant from the shores of
the Persian Gulf. They occupied a strip of territory on the
seaboard to the north of Palestine, about 250 miles long and of
the average width of only 12 miles. The chief cities were Tyre
and Sidon. There are only three representations known to be in
existence of the Ph&oelig;nician ships. They must have been of
considerable size, and have been well manned and equipped, for
the Ph&oelig;nicians traded with every part of the then known world,
and founded colonies&mdash;the principal of which was Carthage&mdash;at
many places along the coast-line of the Mediterranean. A
proof of the size and seaworthiness of their ships was the fact
that they made very distant voyages across notoriously
stormy seas; for instance, to Cornwall in search of tin, and
probably also to the south coast of Ireland. They also
coasted along the western shores of Africa. Somewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
between the years 610 and 594 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> some Ph&oelig;nician ships, acting
under instructions from Pharaoh Nekau, are said to have
circumnavigated Africa, having proceeded from the Indian to
the Southern Ocean, and thence round by the Atlantic and
through the Pillars of Hercules home. The voyage occupied
more than two years, a circumstance which was due to the
fact that they always landed in the autumn and sowed a
tract of country with corn, and waited on shore till it was fit
to cut. In the time of Solomon the joint fleets of the Israelites
and Ph&oelig;nicians made voyages from the head of the Red Sea
down the coasts of Arabia and Eastern Africa, and even to
Persia and Beluchistan, and probably also to India. The
Ph&oelig;nicians were not only great traders themselves, but they
manned the fleets of other nations, and built ships for other
peoples, notably for the Egyptians and Persians. It is unfortunate
that we have so few representations of the Ph&oelig;nician
ships, but we are justified in concluding that they were of
the same general type as those which were used by the Greeks,
the Carthaginians, and eventually by the Romans. The representations
of their vessels known to be in existence were found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
by the late Sir Austin Layard in the palace built by King
Sennacherib at Kouyunjik, near Nineveh, about 700&nbsp;<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> One
of these is shown in Fig. <a href="#f7">7</a>. Though they were obviously
rather symbols of ships than faithful representations, we can,
nevertheless, gather from them that the warship was a galley
provided with a ram, and fitted with a mast carrying a single
square sail; there were also two banks of oars on each side.
The steering was accomplished by two large oars at the stern,
and the fighting troops were carried on a deck or platform
raised on pillars above the heads of the rowers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Shipbuilding in Ancient Greece and Rome.</span></h4>

<p>In considering the history of the development of shipbuilding,
we cannot fail to be struck with the favourable natural
conditions which existed in Greece for the improvement of the
art. On the east and west the mainland was bordered by
inland seas, studded with islands abounding in harbours.
Away to the north-east were other enclosed seas, which
tempted the enterprise of the early navigators. One of the
cities of Greece proper, Corinth, occupied an absolutely
unique position for trade and colonization, situated as it was
on a narrow isthmus commanding two seas. The long narrow
Gulf of Corinth opening into the Mediterranean, and giving
access to the Ionian Islands, must have been a veritable
nursery of the art of navigation, for here the early traders
could sail for long distances, in easy conditions, without
losing sight of land. The Gulf of &AElig;gina and the waters
of the Archipelago were equally favourable. The instincts of
the people were commercial, and their necessities made them
colonizers on a vast scale; moreover, they had at their disposal
the experience in the arts of navigation, acquired from time
immemorial, by the Egyptians and Ph&oelig;nicians. Nevertheless,
with all these circumstances in their favour, the Greeks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
at any rate up to the fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, appear to have
contributed nothing to the improvement of shipbuilding.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
The Egyptians and Ph&oelig;nicians both built triremes as early as
600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but this class of vessel was quite the exception in the
Greek fleets which fought at Salamis 120 years later.</p>

<p>The earliest naval expedition mentioned in Greek history
is that of the allied fleets which transported the armies of
Hellas to the siege of Troy about the year 1237 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> According
to the Greek historians, the vessels used were open boats,
decks not having been introduced into Greek vessels till a
much later period.</p>

<p>The earliest Greek naval battle of which we have any record
took place about the year 709 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, over 500 years after the
expedition to Troy and 1,000 years after the battle depicted in
the Temple of Victory at Thebes. It was fought between the
Corinthians and their rebellious colonists of Corcyra, now
called Corfu.</p>

<p>Some of the naval expeditions recorded in Greek history
were conceived on a gigantic scale. The joint fleets of Persia
and Ph&oelig;nicia which attacked and conquered the Greek
colonies in Ionia consisted of 600 vessels. This expedition
took place in the year 496 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Shortly afterwards the
Persian commander-in-chief, Mardonius, collected a much
larger fleet for the invasion of Greece itself.</p>

<p>After the death of Cambyses, his successor Xerxes collected a
fleet which is stated to have numbered 4,200 vessels, of which
1,200 were triremes. The remainder appears to have been
divided into two classes, of which the larger were propelled
with twenty-five and the smaller with fifteen oars a-side. This
fleet, after many misfortunes at sea, and after gaining a hard-fought
victory over the Athenians, was finally destroyed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>the united Greek fleet at the ever-famous battle of Salamis.
The size of the Persian monarch's fleet was in itself a sufficient
proof of the extent of the naval power of the Levantine states;
but an equally convincing proof of the maritime power of
another Mediterranean state, viz., Carthage, at that early
period&mdash;about 470 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> &mdash;is forthcoming. This State equipped
a large fleet, consisting of 3,000 ships, against the Greek
colonies in Sicily; of these 2,000 were fighting galleys, and the
remainder transports on which no less than 300,000 men were
embarked. This mighty armada was partly destroyed in a
great storm. All the transports were wrecked, and the galleys
were attacked and totally destroyed by the fleets of the Greek
colonists under Gelon on the very day, according to tradition,
on which the Persians were defeated at Salamis. Out of the
entire expedition only a few persons returned to Carthage to
tell the tale of their disasters.</p>

<p>The foregoing account will serve to give a fair idea of the
extent to which shipbuilding was carried on in the Mediterranean
in the fifth century before the Christian era.</p>

<p>We have very little knowledge of the nature of Greek
vessels previously to 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> <a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Thucydides says that the ships
engaged on the Trojan expedition were without decks.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>
<p>According to Homer, 1,200 ships were employed, those of the
B&oelig;otians having 120 men each, and those of Philoctetes 50
men each. Thucydides also relates that the earliest Hellenic
triremes were built at Corinth, and that Ameinocles, a Corinthian
naval architect, built four ships for the Samians about
700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; but triremes did not become common until the
time of the Persian War, except in Sicily and Corcyra (Corfu),
in which states considerable numbers were in use a little
time before the war broke out.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a> is a representation of a Greek bireme of about the
date 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> &mdash;that is to say, of the period immediately
preceding the Persian War. It is taken from a Greek vase in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
British Museum, which was found at Vulci in Etruria. It is
one of the very few representations now in existence of ancient
Greek biremes. It gives us far less information than we could
wish to have. The vessel has two banks of oars, those of the
upper tier passing over the gunwale, and those of the lower
passing through oar-ports. Twenty oars are shown by the
artist on each side, but this is probably not the exact number
used. Unfortunately the rowers of the lower tier are not shown
in position. The steering was effected by means of two large
oars at the stern, after the manner of those in use in the
Egyptian ships previously described. This is proved by
another illustration of a bireme on the same vase, in which the
steering oars are clearly seen. The vessel had a strongly
marked forecastle and a ram fashioned in the shape of a boar's
head. It is a curious fact that Herodotus, in his history
(Book III.), mentions that the Samian ships carried beaks,
formed to resemble the head of a wild boar, and he relates
how the &AElig;ginetans beat some Samian colonists in a sea-fight
off Crete, and sawed off the boar-head beaks from the captured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
galleys, and deposited them in a temple in &AElig;gina. This
sea-fight took place about the same time that the vases were
manufactured, from which Figs. 8 and 9 are copied. There
was a single mast with a very large yard carrying a square
sail. The stays are not shown, but Homer says that the
masts of early Greek vessels were stayed fore and aft.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Fragment of a Greek galley showing absence of deck. About 550 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> </p></div>

<p>It is impossible to say whether this vessel was decked.
According to Thucydides, the ships which the Athenians built
at the instigation of Themistocles, and which they used at
Salamis, were not fully decked. That Greek galleys were
sometimes without decks is proved by Fig. <a href="#f10">10</a>, which is a copy
of a fragment of a painting of a Greek galley on an Athenian
vase now in the British Museum, of the date of about 550 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
It is perfectly obvious, from the human figures in the galley,
that there was no deck. Not even the forecastle was covered
in. The galleys of Figs. 8 and 9 had, unlike the Ph&oelig;nician
bireme of Fig. <a href="#f7">7</a>, no fighting-deck for the use of the soldiers.
There was also no protection for the upper-tier rowers,
and in this respect they were inferior to the Egyptian ship
shown in Fig. <a href="#f6">6</a>. It is probable that Athenian ships at Salamis
also had no fighting, or flying decks for the use of the soldiers;
for, according to Thucydides, Gylippos, when exhorting the
Syracusans, nearly sixty years later, in 413 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, said, "But to
them (the Athenians) the employment of troops on deck is a
novelty." Against this view, however, it must be stated that
there are now in existence at Rome two grotesque pictures
of Greek galleys on a painted vase, dating from about 550 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
in which the soldiers are clearly depicted standing and fighting
upon a flying deck. Moreover, Thucydides, in describing
a sea-fight between the Corinthians and the Corcyreans in
432 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, mentions that the decks of both fleets were crowded
with heavy infantry archers and javelin-men, "for their naval
engagements were still of the old clumsy sort." Possibly this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
last sentence gives us a clue to the explanation of the apparent
discrepancy. The Athenians were, as we know, expert
tacticians at sea, and adopted the method of ramming hostile
ships, instead of lying alongside and leaving the fighting to the
troops on board. They may, however, have been forced to
revert to the latter method, in order to provide for cases
where ramming could not be used; as, for instance, in narrow
harbours crowded with shipping, like that of Syracuse.</p>

<p>It is perfectly certain that the Ph&oelig;nician ships which formed
the most important part of the Persian fleet at Salamis carried
fighting-decks. We have seen already (p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>) that they used
such decks in the time of Sennacherib, and we have the distinct
authority of Herodotus for the statement that they were also
employed in the Persian War; for, he relates that Xerxes
returned to Asia in a Ph&oelig;nician ship, and that great danger
arose during a storm, the vessel having been top-heavy owing
to the deck being crowded with Persian nobles who returned
with the king.</p>

in which the oars were supposed to have been arranged
in one tier. About a century and a half after the battle of
Salamis, in 330 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the Athenians commenced to build ships
with four banks, and five years later they advanced to five
banks. This is proved by the extant inventories of the
Athenian dockyards. According to Diodoros, they were in use
in the Syracusan fleet in 398 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Diodoros, however, died
nearly 350 years after this epoch, and his account must, therefore,
be received with caution.</p>

<p>The evidence in favour of the existence of galleys having
more than five superimposed banks of oars is very slight.</p>

<p>Alexander the Great is said by most of his biographers to
have used ships with five banks of oars; but Quintus Curtius
states that, in 323 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the Macedonian king built a fleet of
seven-banked galleys on the Euphrates. Quintus Curtius is
supposed by the best authorities to have lived five centuries
after the time of Alexander, and therefore his account of these
ships cannot be accepted without question.</p>

<p>It is also related by Diodoros that there were ships of six and
seven banks in the fleet of Demetrios Poliorcetes at a battle
off Cyprus in 306 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and that Antigonos, the father of
Poliorcetes, had ships of eleven and twelve banks. We have
seen, however, that Diodoros died about two and a half
centuries after this period. Pliny, who lived from 61 to
115 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, increases the number of banks in the ships of the
opposing fleets at this battle to twelve and fifteen banks
respectively. It is impossible to place any confidence in such
statements.</p>

<p>Theophrastus, a botanist who died about 288 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and who
was therefore a contemporary of Demetrios, mentions in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
history of plants that the king built an eleven-banked ship in
Cyprus. This is one of the very few contemporary records we
possess of the construction of such ships. The question,
however, arises, Can a botanist be accepted as an accurate
witness in matters relating to shipbuilding? The further
question presents itself, What meaning is intended to be
conveyed by the terms which we translate as ships of many
banks? This question will be reverted to hereafter.</p>

<p>In one other instance a writer cites a document in which
one of these many-banked ships is mentioned as having been
in existence during his lifetime. The author in question was
Polybios, one of the most painstaking and accurate of the
ancient historians, who was born between 214 and 204 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and
who quotes a treaty between Rome and Macedon concluded
in 197 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, in which a Macedonian ship of sixteen banks is
once mentioned. This ship was brought to the Tiber thirty
years later, according to Plutarch and Pliny, who are supposed
to have copied a lost account by Polybios. Both Plutarch and
Pliny were born more than two centuries after this event. If
the alleged account by Polybios had been preserved, it would
have been unimpeachable authority on the subject of this
vessel, as this writer, who was, about the period in question, an
exile in Italy, was tutor in the family of &AElig;milius Paulus, the
Roman general who brought the ship to the Tiber.</p>

<p>The Romans first became a naval power in their wars with
the Carthaginians, when the command of the sea became a
necessity of their existence. This was about 256 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> At
that time they knew nothing whatever of shipbuilding, and
their early war-vessels were merely copies of those used by the
Carthaginians, and these latter were no doubt of the same
general type as the Greek galleys. The first Roman fleet
appears to have consisted of quinqueremes.</p>

<p>The third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> is said to have been an era of gigantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
ships. Ptolemy Philadelphos and Ptolemy Philopater, who
reigned over Egypt during the greater part of that century,
are alleged to have built a number of galleys ranging from
thirteen up to forty banks. The evidence in this case is
derived from two unsatisfactory sources. Athen&aelig;os and
Plutarch quote one Callixenos of Rhodes, and Pliny quotes
one Philostephanos of Cyrene, but very little is known
about either Callixenos or Philostephanos. Fortunately,
however, Callixenos gives details about the size of the
forty-banker, the length of her longest oars, and the number
of her crew, which enables us to gauge his value as an
authority, and to pronounce his story to be incredible (see p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>).</p>

<p>Whatever the arrangement of their oars may have been,
these many-banked ships appear to have been large and
unmanageable, and they finally went out of fashion in the year
31 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when Augustus defeated the combined fleets of
Antony and Cleopatra at the battle of Actium. The vessels
which composed the latter fleets were of the many-banked
order, while Augustus had adopted the swift, low, and handy
galleys of the Liburni, who were a seafaring and piratical people
from Illyria on the Adriatic coast. Their vessels were originally
single-bankers, but afterwards it is said that two banks
were adopted. This statement is borne out by the evidence
of Trajan's Column, all the galleys represented on it, with the
exception of one, being biremes.</p>

<p>Augustus gained the victory at Actium largely owing to the
handiness of his Liburnian galleys, and, in consequence, this
type was henceforward adopted for Roman warships, and ships
of many banks were no longer built. The very word "trireme"
came to signify a warship, without reference to the
number of banks of oars.</p>

<p>After the Romans had completed the conquest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
nations bordering on the Mediterranean, naval war ceased for
a time, and the fighting navy of Rome declined in importance.
It was not till the establishment of the Vandal kingdom in
Africa under Genseric that a revival in naval warfare on a
large scale took place. No changes in the system of marine
architecture are recorded during all these ages. The galley,
considerably modified in later times, continued to be the
principal type of warship in the Mediterranean till about the
sixteenth century of our era.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ancient Merchant-ships.</span></h4>

<p>Little accurate information as we possess about the warships
of the ancients, we know still less of their merchant-vessels and
transports. They were unquestionably much broader, relatively,
and fuller than the galleys; for, whereas the length of
the latter class was often eight to ten times the beam, the
merchant-ships were rarely longer than three or four times
their beam. Nothing is known of the nature of Ph&oelig;nician
merchant-vessels. Fig. <a href="#f12">12</a> is an illustration of an Athenian
merchant-ship of about 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It is taken from the same
painted vase as the galley shown on Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a>. If the illustration
can be relied on, it shows that these early Greek sailing-ships
were not only relatively short, but very deep. The forefoot
and dead wood aft appear to have been cut away to an
extraordinary extent, probably for the purpose of increasing
the handiness. The rigging was of the type which was
practically universal in ancient ships.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#f13">13</a> gives the sheer draught or side elevation, the plan,
elevations of the bow and stem, and a midship section of a
Roman vessel, which from her proportions and the shape of
bow is supposed to have been a merchant-ship. The illustration
is taken from a model presented to Greenwich Hospital
by Lord Anson. The original model was of white marble, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
was found in the Villa Mattei in Rome, in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>We know from St. Paul's experiences, as described in the
Acts of the Apostles, that Mediterranean merchant-ships
must often have been of considerable size, and that they were
capable of going through very stormy voyages. St. Paul's
ship contained a grain cargo, and carried 276 human beings.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Greek merchant-ship. About 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> </p></div>

<p>In the merchant-ships oars were only used as an auxiliary
means of propulsion, the principal reliance being placed on
masts and sails. Vessels of widely different sizes were in
use, the larger carrying 10,000 talents, or 250 tons of cargo.
Sometimes, however, much bigger ships were used. For
instance, Pliny mentions a vessel in which the Vatican obelisk
and its pedestal, weighing together nearly 500 tons, were
brought from Egypt to Italy about the year 50 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> It is
further stated that this vessel carried an additional cargo of
800 tons of lentils to keep the obelisk from shifting on board.</p>

<p>Lucian, writing in the latter half of the second century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
mentions, in one of his Dialogues, the dimensions of a ship
which carried corn from Egypt to the Pir&aelig;us. The figures are:
length, 180 ft.; breadth, nearly 50 ft.; depth from deck
to bottom of hold, 43&frac12; ft. The latter figure appears to be
incredible. The other dimensions are approximately those of
the <i>Royal George</i>, described on p. <a href="#Page_126">126</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Details of the Construction of Greek and Roman
Galleys.</span></h4>

<p>It is only during the present century that we have learned,
with any certainty, what the ancient Greek galleys were like.
In the year 1834 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> it was discovered that a drain at the
Pir&aelig;us had been constructed with a number of slabs bearing
inscriptions, which, on examination, turned out to be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
inventories of the ancient dockyard of the Pir&aelig;us. From these
inscriptions an account of the Attic triremes has been derived
by the German writers Boeckh and Graser. The galleys all
appear to have been constructed on much the same model,
with interchangeable parts. The dates of the slabs range from
373 to 323 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and the following description must be taken
as applying only to galleys built within this period.</p>

<p>The length, exclusive of the beak, or ram, must have been at
least 126 ft., the ram having an additional length of 10 ft.
The length was, of course, dictated by the maximum number
of oars in any one tier, by the space which it was found
necessary to leave between each oar, and by the free spaces
between the foremost oar and the stem, and the aftermost
oar and the stern of the ship. Now, as it appears further on,
the maximum number of oars in any tier in a trireme was 62
in the top bank, which gives 31 a side. If we allow only
3 ft. between the oars we must allot at least 90 ft. to the portion
of the vessel occupied by the rowers. The free spaces at
stem and stern were, according to the representations of
those vessels which have come down to us, about 7/24th of the
whole; and, if we accept this proportion, the length of a
trireme, independently of its beak, would be about 126 ft. 6 in.
If the space allotted to each rower be increased, as it may
very reasonably be, the total length of the ship would also
have to be increased proportionately. Hence it is not surprising
that some authorities put the length at over 140 ft.
It may be mentioned in corroboration, that the ruins of the
Athenian docks at Zea show that they were originally at least
150 ft. long. They were also 19 ft. 5 in. wide. The breadth
of a trireme at the water-line, amidships, was about 14 ft.,
perhaps increasing somewhat higher up, the sides tumbled
home above the greatest width. These figures give the width
of the hull proper, exclusive of an outrigged gangway, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
deck, which, as subsequently explained, was constructed along
the sides as a passage for the soldiers and seamen. The
draught was from 7 to 8 ft.</p>

<p>Such a vessel carried a crew of from 200 to 225, of whom 174
were rowers, 20 seamen to work the sails, anchors, etc., and the
remainder soldiers. Of the rowers, 62 occupied the upper, 58
the middle and 54 the lower tier. Many writers have supposed
that each oar was worked by several rowers, as in the galleys
of the Middle Ages. This, however, was not the case, for it
has been conclusively proved that, in the Greek galleys, up
to the class of triremes, at any rate, there was only one man to
each oar. For instance, Thucydides, describing the surprise
attack intended to be delivered on the Pir&aelig;us, and actually
delivered against the island of Salamis by the Peloponnesians
in 429 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, relates that the sailors were marched from Corinth
to Nis&aelig;a, the harbour of Megara, on the Athenian side of the
isthmus, in order to launch forty ships which happened to be
lying in the docks there, and that <i>each</i> sailor carried his
cushion and his oar, with its thong, on his march. We have,
moreover, a direct proof of the size of the longest oars used in
triremes, for the inventories of the Athenian dockyards expressly
state that they were 9&frac12; cubits, or 13 ft. 6 in. in length.
The reason why the oars were arranged in tiers, or banks,
one above the other was, no doubt, that, in this way, the
propelling power could be increased without a corresponding
increase in the length of the ships. To make a long sea-going
vessel sufficiently strong without a closed upper deck would
have severely taxed the skill of the early shipbuilders. Moreover,
long vessels would have been very difficult to man&oelig;uvre,
and in the Greek mode of fighting, ramming being one of the
chief modes of offence, facility in man&oelig;uvring was of prime
importance. The rowers on each side sat in the same vertical
longitudinal plane, and consequently the length of the inboard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
portions of the oars varied according as the curve of the
vessel's side approached or receded from this vertical plane.
The seats occupied by the rowers in the successive tiers were
arranged one above the other in oblique lines sloping upwards
towards the stem, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15. The vertical
distance between the seats was about 2 ft. The horizontal gap
between the benches in each tier was about 3 ft. The seats were
some 9 in. wide, and foot-supports were fixed to each for the
use of the rower next above and behind. The oars were so
arranged that the blades in each tier all struck the water in the
same fore and aft line. The lower oar-ports were about 3 ft.,
the middle 4&frac14; ft., and the upper 5&frac12; ft., above the water. The
water was prevented from entering the ports by means of
leather bags fastened round the oars and to the sides of the
oar-ports. The upper oars were about 14 ft. long, the middle
10 ft., and the lower 7&frac12; ft., and in addition to these there were
a few extra oars which were occasionally worked from the platform,
or deck, above the upper tier, probably by the seamen and
soldiers when they were not otherwise occupied. The benches
for the rowers extended from the sides to timber supports,
inboard, arranged in vertical planes fore and aft. There were
two sets of these timbers, one belonging to each side of the
ship, and separated by a space of 7 ft. These timbers also
connected the upper and lower decks together. The latter
was about 1 ft. above the water-line. Below the lower deck
was the hold which contained the ballast, and in which the
apparatus for baling was fixed.</p>

<p>In addition to oars, sails were used as a means of propulsion
whenever the wind was favourable, but not in action.</p>

<p>The Athenian galleys had, at first, one mast, but afterwards,
it is thought, two were used. The mainmast was furnished
with a yard and square sail.</p>

<p>The upper deck, which was the fighting-platform previously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
mentioned, was originally a flying structure, and, perhaps, did
not occupy the full width of the vessel amidships. At the
bow, however, it was connected by planking with the sides of
the ship, so as to form a closed-in space, or forecastle. This
forecastle would doubtless have proved of great use in keeping
the ship dry during rough weather, and probably suggested
ultimately the closed decking of the whole of the ship. There
is no record of when this feature, which was general in
ancient Egyptian vessels, was introduced into Greek galleys.
It was certainly in use in the Roman warships about the
commencement of the Christian era, for there is in the
Vatican a relief of about the date 50 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> from the Temple of
Fortune at Pr&aelig;neste, which represents part of a bireme, in
which the rowers are all below a closed deck, on which the
soldiers are standing.</p>

<p>In addition to the fighting-deck proper there were the two
side platforms, or gangways, already alluded to, which were
carried right round the outside of the vessel on about the same
level as the benches of the upper tier of rowers. These platforms
projected about 18 to 24 in. beyond the sides of the hull,
and were supported on brackets. Like the flying deck, these
passages were intended for the accommodation of the soldiers
and sailors, who could, by means of them, move freely round
the vessel without interfering with the rowers. They were
frequently fenced in with stout planking on the outside, so
as to protect the soldiers. They do not appear to have been
used on galleys of the earliest period.</p>

<p>We have no direct evidence as to the dimensions of ships of
four and five banks. Polybios tells us that the crew of a
Roman quinquereme in the first Carthaginian War, at a battle
fought in 256 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, numbered 300, in addition to 120 soldiers.
Now, the number 300 can be obtained by adding two banks of
respectively 64 and 62 rowers to the 172 of the trireme. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
may, perhaps, infer that the quinquereme of that time was a
little longer than the trireme, and had about 3 ft. more
freeboard, this being the additional height required to accommodate
two extra banks of oars. Three hundred years later
than the above-mentioned date Pliny tells us that this type
of galley carried 400 rowers.</p>

<p>We know no detailed particulars of vessels having a greater
number of banks than five till we get to the alleged forty-banker
of Ptolemy Philopater. Of this ship Callixenos
gives the following particulars:&mdash;Her dimensions were:
length, 420 ft.; breadth, 57 ft.; draught, under 6 ft.;
height of stern ornament above water-line, 79 ft. 6 in.;
height of stem ornament, 72 ft.; length of the longest oars,
57 ft. The oars were stated to have been weighted with
lead inboard, so as to balance the great overhanging length.
The number of the rowers was 4,000, and of the remainder of
the crew 3,500, making a total of 7,500 men, for whom, we are
asked to believe, accommodation was found on a vessel of the
dimensions given. This last statement is quite sufficient to
utterly discredit the whole story, as it implies that each man
had a cubic space of only about 130 ft. to live in, and that, too,
in the climate of Egypt. Moreover, if we look into the question
of the oars we shall see that the dimensions given are
absolutely impossible&mdash;that is to say, if we make the usual
assumption that the banks were successive horizontal tiers
of oars placed one above the other. There were said to have
been forty banks. Now, the smallest distance, vertically,
between two successive banks, if the oar-ports were arranged
as in Fig. <a href="#f14">14</a>, with the object of economizing space in the
vertical direction to the greatest possible degree, would be
1 ft. 3 in. If the lowest oar-ports were 3 ft. above the water,
and the topmost bank were worked on the gunwale, we should
require, to accommodate forty banks, a height of side equal to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
39 ft. &times; 1 ft. 3 in. + 3 ft. = 51 ft. 9 in. Now, if the inboard portion
of the 57 ft. oar were only one-fourth of the whole length,
or 14 ft. 3 in., this would leave 57 ft. - 14 ft. 3 in. = 42 ft. 9 in.
for the outboard portion, and as the height of gunwale on
which this particular length of oar was worked must have been,
as shown above, 51 ft. 9 in. above the water, it is evident that
the outboard portion of the oar could not be made to touch the
water at all. Also, if we consider the conditions of structural
strength of the side of a ship honeycombed with oar-ports, and
standing to the enormous height of 51 ft. 9 in. above the water-line,
it is evident that, in order to be secure, it would require to
be supported by numerous tiers of transverse horizontal beams,
similar to deck-beams, running from side to side. The planes
of these tiers would intersect the inboard portions of many of
the tiers of oars, and consequently prevent these latter from
being fitted at all.</p>

<p>If we look at the matter from another point of view we shall
meet with equally absurd results. The oars in the upper banks
of Athenian triremes are known to have been about 14 ft. in
length. Underneath them, were, of course, two other banks.
If, now, we assume that the upper bank tholes were 5 ft. 6 in.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
above the water-line, and that one-quarter of the length of the
upper bank oars was inboard, and if we add thirty-seven
additional banks parallel to the first bank, so as to make forty
in all, simple proportion will show us that the outboard portion
of the oars of the uppermost bank must have been just under
99 ft. long and the total length of each, if we assume, as before,
that one quarter of it was inboard, would be 132 ft., instead of
the 57 ft. given by Callixenos. Any variations in the above
assumptions, consistent with possibilities, would only have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>the effect of bringing the oars out still longer. We are therefore
driven to conclude, either that the account given by
Callixenos was grossly inaccurate, or else that the Greek
word, &#964;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#7968;&#961;&#951;&#962;, which we translate by "forty-banked
ship," did not imply that there were forty horizontal <i>super-imposed</i>
tiers of oars.</p>

<p>The exact arrangement of the oars in the larger classes of
galleys has always been a puzzle, and has formed the subject
of much controversy amongst modern writers on naval architecture.
The vessels were distinguished, according to the
numbers of the banks of oars, as uniremes, biremes, triremes,
quadriremes, etc., up to ships like the great galley of Ptolemy
Philopater, which was said to have had forty banks. Now,
the difficulty is to know what is meant by a bank of oars. It
was formerly assumed that the term referred to the horizontal
tiers of oars placed one above the other; but it can easily be
proved, by attempting to draw the galleys with the oars and
rowers in place, that it would be very difficult to accommodate
as many as five horizontal banks and absolutely impossible to
find room for more than seven. Not only would the space
within the hull of the ship be totally insufficient for the rowers,
but the length of the upper tiers of oars would be so great that
they would be unmanageable, and that of the lower tiers so
small that they would be inefficient. The details given by
ancient writers throw very little light upon this difficult
subject. Some authors have stated that there was only one
man to each oar, and we now know that this was the case with
the smaller classes of vessels, say, up to those provided with
three, or four, to five banks of oars; but it is extremely
improbable that the oars of the larger classes could have
been so worked. The oars of modern Venetian galleys were
each manned by five rowers. It is impossible in this work to
examine closely into all the rival theories as to what constituted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
a bank of oars. It seems improbable, for reasons before stated,
that any vessel could have had more than five horizontal tiers.
It is certain also that, in order to find room for the rowers to
work above each other in these tiers, the oar-ports must have
been placed, not vertically above each other, but in oblique
rows, as represented in Fig. <a href="#f14">14</a>. It is considered by Mr.
W. S. Lindsay, in his "History of Merchant Shipping and
Ancient Commerce," that each of the oblique rows of oars, thus
arranged, may have formed the tier referred to in the designation
of the class of the vessel, for vessels larger than quinqueremes.
If this were so, there would then be no difficulty
in conceiving the possibility of constructing galleys with even
as many as forty tiers of oars like the huge alleged galley of
Ptolemy Philopater. Fig. <a href="#f15">15</a> represents the disposition of the
oar-ports according to this theory for an octoreme.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;Suggested arrangement of oar-ports in an octoreme.</p></div>

<p>It appears to be certain that the oars were not very advantageously
arranged, or proportioned, in the old Greek galleys,
or even in the Roman galleys, till the time of the early C&aelig;sars,
for we read that the average speed of the Athenian triremes
was 200 stadia in the day. If the stadium were equal in
length to a furlong, and the working day supposed to be limited
to ten hours, this would correspond to a speed of only two and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
half miles an hour. The lengths of the oars in the Athenian
triremes have been already given (p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>); even those of the
upper banks were extremely short&mdash;only, in fact, about a foot
longer than those used in modern 8-oared racing boats. On
account of their shortness and the height above the water at
which they were worked, the angle which the oars made with
the water was very steep and consequently disadvantageous.
In the case of the Athenian triremes, this angle must have been
about 23.5&deg;. This statement is confirmed by all the paintings
and sculptures which have come down to us. It is proved
equally by the painting of an Athenian bireme of 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
shown in Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a>, and by the Roman trireme, founded on the
sculptures of Trajan's Column of about 110 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, shown in
Fig. <a href="#f16">16</a>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> In fact, it is evident that the ancients, before the
time of the introduction of the Liburnian galley, did not
understand the art of rowing as we do to-day. The celebrated
Liburnian galleys, which were first used by the Romans, for
war purposes, at the battle of Actium under Augustus C&aelig;sar,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>were said to have had a speed of four times that of the old
triremes. The modern galleys used in the Mediterranean
in the seventeenth century are said to have occasionally
made the passage from Naples to Palermo in seventeen hours.
This is equivalent to an average speed of between 11 and 12
miles per hour.</p>

<p>The timber used by the ancient races on the shores of the
Mediterranean in the construction of their ships appears to
have been chiefly fir and oak; but, in addition to these, many
other varieties, such as pitch pine, elm, cedar, chestnut, ilex,
or evergreen oak, ash, and alder, and even orange wood, appear
to have been tried from time to time. They do not seem to
have understood the virtue of using seasoned timber, for we
read in ancient history of fleets having been completed ready
for sea in incredibly short periods after the felling of the trees.
Thus, the Romans are said to have built and equipped a fleet
of 220 vessels in 45 days for the purpose of resisting the
attacks of Hiero, King of Syracuse. In the second Punic War
Scipio put to sea with a fleet which was stated to have been
completed in forty days from the time the timber was felled.
On the other hand, the ancients believed in all sorts of absurd
rules as to the proper day of the moon on which to fell trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
for shipbuilding purposes, and also as to the quarter from which
the wind should blow, and so forth. Thus, Hesiod states
that timber should only be cut on the seventeenth day of the
moon's age, because the sap, which is the great cause of early
decay, would then be sunk, the moon being on the wane.
Others extend the time from the fifteenth to the twenty-third
day of the moon, and appeal with confidence to the experience
of all artificers to prove that timber cut at any other period
becomes rapidly worm-eaten and rotten. Some, again,
asserted that if felled on the day of the new moon the
timber would be incorruptible, while others prescribed a
different quarter from which the wind should blow for
every season of the year. Probably on account of the ease
with which it was worked, fir stood in high repute as a material
for shipbuilding.</p>

<p>The structure of the hulls of ancient ships was not dissimilar
in its main features to that of modern wooden vessels. The
very earliest types were probably without external keels. As
the practice of naval architecture advanced, keels were introduced,
and served the double purpose of a foundation for the
framing of the hull and of preventing the vessel from making
leeway in a wind. Below the keel proper was a false keel,
which was useful when vessels were hauled up on shore, and
above the keelson was an upper false keel, into which the masts
were stepped. The stem formed an angle of about 70&deg; with the
water-line, and its junction with the keel was strengthened
by a stout knee-piece. The design of the stem above water was
often highly ornate. The stern generally rose in a graceful
curve, and was also lavishly ornamented. Fig. <a href="#f18">18</a> gives some
illustrations of the highly ornamented extremities of the stern
and prow of Roman galleys. These show what considerable
pains the ancients bestowed on the decoration of their vessels.
There was no rudder-post, the steering having been effected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
by means of special oars, as in the early Egyptian vessels.
Into the keel were notched the floor timbers, and the heads
of these latter were bound together by the keelson, or inner
keel. Beams connected the top timbers of the opposite
branches of the ribs and formed the support for the deck.
The planking was put on at right angles to the frames, the
butting ends of the planks being connected by dovetails. The
skin of the ship was strengthened, in the Athenian galleys, by
means of stout planks, or waling-pieces, carried horizontally
round the ship, each pair meeting together in front of the
stem, where they formed the foundations for the beaks, or
rams. The hulls were further strengthened by means of
girding-cables, also carried horizontally round the hull, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
angles formed by the projection of the waling-pieces beyond
the skin. These cables passed through an eye-hole at the stem,
and were tightened up at the stern by means of levers. It is
supposed that they were of use in holding
the ship together under the shock of ramming.
The hull was made water-tight by
caulking the seams of the planking.
Originally this was accomplished with a
paste formed of ground sea-shells and
water. This paste, however, not having
much cohesion, was liable to crack and
fall out when the vessel strained. A
slight improvement was made when the shells were calcined
and turned into lime. Pitch and wax were also employed,
but were eventually superseded by the use of flax, which
was driven in between the seams. Flax was certainly used for
caulking in the time of Alexander the
Great, and a similar material has continued
to be employed for this purpose down
to the present day. In addition to caulking
the seams, it was also customary to
coat over the bottom with pitch, and the
Romans, at any rate, used sometimes to
sheath their galleys with sheet lead fastened
to the planking with copper nails.
This was proved by the discovery of one
of Trajan's galleys in Lake Riccio after it
had been submerged for over thirteen
centuries.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Stem and stern ornaments of galleys.</p></div>

<p>The bows of the ancient war galleys were so constructed as
to act as rams. The ram was made of hard timber projecting

<span class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a name="f19" id="f19"></a><img src="images/fig19.png" width="150" height="173"

beyond the line of the bow, between it and the forefoot.
It was usually made of oak, elm, or ash, even when all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
rest of the hull was constructed of soft timber. In later
times it was sheathed with, or even made entirely of,
bronze. It was often highly ornamented, either with a
carved head of a ram or some other animal, as shown
in Figs. 8 to 11; sometimes swords or spear-heads were
added, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20. A relic of this
ancient custom is found to this day in the ornamentation

<span class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a name="f20" id="f20"></a><img src="images/fig20.png"

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Bow of

of the prows of the Venetian gondolas. Originally the ram,
or rostrum, was visible above the water-line, but it was
afterwards found to be far more effective when wholly
immersed. In addition to the rams there were side projections,
or catheads, above water near the bow. The
ram was used for sinking the opposing vessels by penetrating
their hulls, and the catheads for shattering their oars
when sheering up suddenly alongside. Roman galleys were
fitted with castles, or turrets, in which were placed fighting
men and various engines of destruction. They were frequently
temporary structures, sometimes consisting of little
more than a protected platform, mounted on scaffolding,
which could be easily taken down and stowed away.
The use of these structures was continued till far into the
Middle Ages.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4>ANCIENT SHIPS IN THE SEAS OF NORTHERN EUROPE.</h4>


<p>Outside the Mediterranean it is known that some of the
northern nations had attained to very considerable skill in the
arts of shipbuilding and navigation. C&aelig;sar gives a general
description of the ships of the Veneti, who occupied the
country now known as Brittany, and who had in their hands
the carrying trade between Gaul and Britain.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> As might
be expected from the stormy nature of the Atlantic, the
Veneti were not able to place any reliance on oars as a means
for propulsion. According to C&aelig;sar's account, they trusted
solely to sails. Their vessels were built entirely of oak of
great thickness. He also mentions that the beams were as
much as 12 in. in depth. The bottoms of these vessels were
very flat, so as to enable them the better to be laid up on the
beach. The hulls had considerable sheer, both at the stem and
stern. The sails were of dressed hide, and the cables were iron
chains. It is evident from this cursory description that the
ships of the Veneti were not based upon Mediterranean models,
and it is highly probable that they, rather than the oar-propelled
galleys, may be regarded as the prototypes of the
early sea-going vessels of Northern Europe.</p>

<p>Although the art of ship construction had attained to great
importance amongst the Veneti, their neighbours, the Britons,
were still very backward in this respect at the time of the first
Roman invasion. C&aelig;sar states that their vessels were of very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>slight construction, the framework being made of light timber,
over which was stretched a covering, or skin, of strong hides.
Sometimes the framework was of wicker.</p>

<p>The ancient Saxons, who were notorious as pirates on the
North Sea, made use of boats similar to those of the ancient
Britons. At the time of their invasion of Britain, however,
their vessels must have been larger and of more solid construction,
though we must dismiss, as an obvious absurdity,
the statement that the first invading army of 9,000 men was
carried to this country in three ships only. It is much more
probable that the expedition was embarked in three fleets.</p>

<p>The Saxon kings of England often maintained very considerable
fleets for the purpose of protecting the coast from the
Danes.</p>

<p>Alfred the Great is generally regarded as the founder of the
English Navy. He designed ships which were of a better type
and larger size than those of his enemies, the Danes. They
were said to have been twice as long as the vessels which they
superseded. The Saxon Chronicle says, "They were full twice
as long as the others; some had sixty oars, and some had
more; they were swifter and steadier, and also higher than the
others; they were shaped neither like the Frisian, nor the
Danish, but so as it seemed to him they would be most efficient."
In 897 Alfred met and defeated a Danish squadron, in all
probability with his new ships.</p>

<p>Edgar (959 to 975) is stated to have kept at sea no less than
3,600 vessels of various sizes, divided into three fleets, and the
old historian William of Malmesbury tells us that this king took
an active personal interest in his navy, and that in summer
time he would, in turn, embark and cruise with each of the
squadrons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f21" id="f21"></a><img src="images/fig21.png"
width="500" height="428" alt="Anglo-Saxon ship. About 900 A.D." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Anglo-Saxon ship. About 900 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#f21">21</a> is an illustration of an Anglo-Saxon ship taken from
an old Saxon calendar, which is, or was, in the Cottonian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Library, and which is supposed to have been written about half
a century before the Norman Conquest. It is reproduced
in Strutt's "Compleat View of the Manners, Customs, Arms,
Habits, etc., of the Inhabitants of England, from the arrival
of the Saxons till the reign of Henry VIII.," published in 1775.
The proportions of the boat as represented are obviously
impossible. The sketch is, however, interesting, as showing
the general form and mode of planking of the vessel, and the
nature of the decorations of the bow and stern. We see that
the vessel was a warship, as the keel prolonged formed a
formidable ram. We also may notice that the sail was relied
on as a principal means of propulsion, for there are apparently
no notches or rowlocks for oars. The steering was effected
by two large oars, in a similar manner to that adopted by the
ancient Egyptians and other Mediterranean peoples. The
extraordinary character of the deck-house will be observed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
It is, of course, purely symbolical, and may, at most, be interpreted
as meaning that the vessel carried some sort of structure
on deck.</p>

<p>In the seventh and eighth centuries of the Christian era the
scene of maritime activity was transferred from the Mediterranean
to the North of Europe. The Norsemen, who overran
the whole of the European seaboard at one time or another,
were the most famous navigators of the period immediately
preceding the Middle Ages. Any record connected with their
system of ship-construction is necessarily of great interest.
The fleets of the Norsemen penetrated into the Mediterranean
as far as the imperial city of the Eastern emperors. In the
north they discovered and colonized Iceland, and even Greenland;
and there are good grounds for believing that an
expedition, equipped in Iceland, founded a colony in what are
now the New England States five centuries before Columbus
discovered the West Indies. Unfortunately, the written
descriptions extant of the Norse ships are extremely meagre,
and if it had not been for the curious custom of the Norsemen of
burying their great chiefs in one of their ships and heaping
earth over the entire mass, we should now know nothing for
certain of the character of their vessels. Many of these ship-tombs
have been discovered in modern times, but it happened
in the majority of instances that the character of the earth used
was unsuited to their preservation, and most of the woodwork
was found to be decayed when the mounds were explored.
Fortunately, however, in two instances the vessels were
buried in blue clay, which is an excellent preserver of timber,
and, thanks to the discovery of these, we have now a tolerably
complete knowledge of the smaller classes of vessels used by the
Vikings. One of them was discovered, in 1867, at Haugen,
but by far the most important was found in 1880, at Gogstad,
near Sandefjord, at the entrance of the Fjord of Christiania.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Though this vessel is comparatively small, she is, probably, a
correct representative of the larger type of ships made use of
by the renowned adventurers of the North in their distant
expeditions.</p>

<p>In view of the great interest attaching to this find, a detailed
description of the vessel is given. The illustrations
(Figs. 22 to 26), showing an end elevation, longitudinal and
cross-sections, and the half-plan with her lines, are taken from
the "Transactions of the Institution of Naval Architects."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
The boat was clinker-built and wholly of oak. Her principal
dimensions are: length, 77 ft. 11 in.; extreme breadth, 16 ft.
7 in.; and depth, from top of keel to gunwale, 5 ft. 9 in. The
keel is 14 in. deep, the part below the rabbet of the garboard
or lowest strakes of the planking, being 11 in. deep, and 4&frac12; in.
thick at the bottom. The width across the rabbet is 3 in., while
the portion above the rabbet and inboard is 7 in. wide. The
keel and stem and stern-posts run into each other with very
gentle curves. The keel itself is 57 ft. long, and to it are
connected, by vertical scarves and a double row of iron rivets,
the forefoot and heel-pieces, which latter are fastened in a
similar manner to the stem and stern-post. These posts are
15 in. deep at the scarf, gradually tapering upwards. The
framing of the bottom is formed of grown floors resting on the
top of the keel, and extending in one piece, from shelf to shelf,
as shown on the transverse section (Fig. <a href="#f22">23</a>). There are
nineteen of these floors in all, spaced in the body of the boat,
on the average 3 ft. 3 in. apart. They are 4 in. in diameter
at the garboard strake, and taper in both dimensions, so that
they are less than 3 in. at the shelf. They are not fastened
to the keel. The planking is put on clinker fashion. There
are sixteen strakes a side, the breadth of each, amidships,
being on the average 9&frac12; in., including the land of 1 in., and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>the length of planks varies from 8 ft. to 24 ft. The thickness
is generally 1 in. The tenth plank from the keel is, however,
1-3/4 in. thick, and forms a kind of shelf for the beam-ends.
The third plank from the top is 1&frac14; in. thick, and is pierced
with 4-in. holes for the oars, of which there are sixteen on each
side. The two upper strakes are only 3/4 in. thick, and inside the
top one is placed the gunwale, which is 3 &times; 4&frac12;. The planks
are fastened together by iron rivets spaced from 6 in. to 8 in.
apart. The heads of the rivets are 1 in. in diameter, and the
riveting plates 1/2 in. square. The planks are worked down
from thicker slabs, and a ledge 1 in. in height is left on the
inboard surface of the middle of each plank. The planks
bear against each floor at two points, viz. the upper edge and
the projecting ledge. Fig. <a href="#f22">24</a> shows a section of a floor and of
the plank, with its projecting ledge. The fastenings of the
planking to the floors are very peculiar. Two holes are bored
transversely in the ledge, one on either side of each floor.
There is a corresponding hole running fore and aft through
the floor, and through these holes are passed ties made of the
tough roots of trees barely 1/4 in. in diameter, crossed on the
ledge and passing once through each hole. The only iron
fastening between the planking and the floors is at the extreme
ends of the latter, where a single nail is driven through each,
and riveted at the ends of the floors. The beams rest on the
shelf strake and on the tops of the floor-ends. They are 7 in.
deep and 4 in. wide. They are connected with the planking
by knees (see the section, Fig. <a href="#f22">23</a>), fastened to their upper faces
and to the side of the ship as far up as the oar-strake, or
"mainwale," by means of oak trenails. The knees are not so
wide as the beams, and consequently a ledge, or landing, is
left on each side of the latter which supports the flooring, or
bottom boards. The top strakes are connected to the body
of the vessel by short timbers, shown in the section, Fig. <a href="#f22">23</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
These are placed in the spaces between the knees. The beams
are supported in the middle by short pillars resting on the
throats of the floors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f22" id="f22"></a>
<a href="images/fig22_26z.png"><img src="images/fig22_26.png" width="500" height="318" alt="Viking
ship." title="" /></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Viking ship.</p></div>

<p>The vessel was propelled by sails as well as oars. It was
fitted with a single mast; the arrangements for stepping and
raising and lowering the latter were peculiar. A beam of oak,
11 ft. long, 19 in. wide, and 14 in. deep, formed the step. A
side elevation of this is shown at <i>s</i>, in the longitudinal section,
Fig. <a href="#f22">25</a>, and a cross-section in Fig. <a href="#f22">23</a>. The step, as may be
seen, is countersunk over the throats of the floors; it is tapered
towards the ends, and a piece (<i>c</i>) nearly 12 in. thick, immediately
forward of the mast, rises vertically out of it. This
piece is fastened to a huge log of oak, 16 ft. long, 38 in. broad,
and 14 in. deep in the middle, marked <i>f</i> (Figs. 25 and 26), which
rests on a sole-piece about 4 in. thick. The sole-piece is
countersunk over the beams. The large log is called by Mr.
Colin Archer the "fish," partly because its ends are fashioned
to represent the tails of two whales, and partly because the
mast partners of modern ships, which take the place of this
heavy piece, are to this day called <i>Fisken</i> in Norway. The
fish contains a slot (<i>h</i>) nearly 6 ft. long, and the same width
as the mast, 12&frac12; in. The mast goes through the forward end
of the slot, and when it is in use the slot is filled up with a heavy
slab. When the mast is lowered for going into action, or when
going against a head-wind, the slab is removed, and the fore-stay
slacked off, thus permitting the mast to fall aft. The
sail used was a solitary square one. The rudder resembles
a short oar. It is hung by a rope passing through a perforated
conical chock on the starboard side of the ship. There is an
iron eyebolt near the bottom edge, through which a rope
probably passed for the purpose of raising the rudder when not
in use. The rudder was worked by means of a tiller fitted
into the socket at the upper end.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>Unfortunately, the two extreme ends of the ship have
decayed away, so that it is not possible to determine with
accuracy what was the appearance of the bow and stern. It
is, however, probable, from the direction taken by the planking
towards the ends, that the vessel possessed very considerable
sheer. As may be seen from the plan, the character of the
lines was extremely fine, and it is probable that the boat was
capable of high speed. The remains of the ropes which have
been discovered prove that they were made from the bark of
trees.</p>

<p>This vessel may be considered as a connecting link between
the ancient and medi&aelig;val types of ships. Her proportions and
scantlings prove that her builders had a large experience of
shipbuilding, that they fully understood how to work their
material and to adapt it properly to the duty it had to fulfil,
and also that they understood the art, which was subsequently
lost, to be revived only in modern times, of shaping the underwater
portion of the hull so as to reduce the resistance to the
passage of the vessel through the water. The only part of the
structural design to which any serious exception can be taken is
the very slight character of the connection between the top
sides and the body of the boat, and even this defect was
probably not very serious when we take into account the
lightness of the loading, and the fact that it probably consisted
chiefly of live cargo, so that there was little dead weight
to cause serious straining.</p>

<p>Vessels of the type of the Viking ships were built in Denmark
at a very early date. In 1865 three boats were discovered
buried in a peat bog in Jutland. Danish antiquaries consider
that they were built about the fifth century of our era. The
largest is 70 ft. in length and of such an excellent type that
boats of somewhat similar form and construction are in
universal use to this day all round the coasts of Norway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Such an instance of persistency in type is without parallel in
the history of shipbuilding, and is a wonderful proof of the
skill of the Norsemen in designing and building vessels. The
boat in question is clinker-built, the planks having the same
peculiarities as those of the Viking ship just described. It is
of the same shape at both ends, and has great sheer at both
stem and stern. The rowlocks, of which there are thirty,
prove that the vessel was intended to be rowed in either
direction. This also is a peculiarity of the modern Norwegian
rowboat. The steering was effected by means of a large oar,
or paddle. There is no trace of a mast, nor of any fitting to
receive one; nor was the vessel decked. The internal framing
was admirably contrived. In fact, it would be difficult, even at
the present time, to find a vessel in which lightness and strength
were better combined than in this fifteen-hundred-year-old
specimen of the shipbuilder's art.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4>MEDI&AElig;VAL SHIPS.</h4>


<p>In the times of the Norman kings of England both the war and
the mercantile navies of the country were highly developed.
William the Conqueror invaded this island without the assistance
of a war navy. He trusted to good luck to transport his
army across the Channel in an unprotected fleet of small
vessels which were built for this purpose, and which were burnt
by his order when the landing had been effected. We possess
illustrations of these transport vessels from a contemporary
source&mdash;the Bayeux tapestry, which was, according to tradition,
the work of Queen Matilda, the Conqueror's consort.
Fig. <a href="#f27">27</a> represents one of these vessels. It is obviously of
Scandinavian type, resembling in some of its features the
Viking ship shown in Figs. 22 to 26. Apparently, oars were
not used in this particular boat; the propulsion was effected
by means of a single square sail. The mast unshipped, as we
know from other illustrations on the same piece of tapestry.
The steering was effected by a rudder, or steering-board, on the
starboard-side. In all the illustrations of ships in this tapestry
the main sheet was held by the steersman, a fact which shows
that the Normans were cautious navigators. Another ship
is represented with ten horses on board.</p>

<p>We possess confirmatory evidence that the ship shown in
Fig. <a href="#f27">27</a> represents a type that was prevalent on our coasts in
the eleventh and two following centuries, for very similar
boats are shown in the transcript of Matthew Paris's "History<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of the Two Kings of Offa" (now in the Cottonian Library),
the illustrations in which are supposed to have been drawn
by Matthew Paris himself. The history is that of two Saxon
princes who lived in the latter half of the eighth century, and
was written in the first half of the thirteenth. We may fairly
suppose that the illustrations represented the types of vessels
with which the historian was familiar. They were all of the
type depicted in the Bayeux tapestry. They are of the same
shape at both ends, just like the Viking ship, and it may be
added, like the boats to this day in common use along the
coasts of Norway.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;One of William the Conqueror's ships. 1066 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p></div>

<p>It must not be supposed that the art of building ships of
larger size, which was, as we have seen, well understood by the
Romans, about the commencement of our era, was forgotten.
On the contrary, though, no doubt, the majority of ships of
the eleventh and twelfth centuries were of small dimensions, yet
we occasionally meet with notices of vessels of comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
large size. Such an one, for instance, was <i>La Blanche Nef</i>,
built in the reign of Henry I., and lost on the coast of Normandy
in the year 1120 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> This ship was built for Prince
William, the son of the King, and he was lost in her, together
with 300 passengers and crew. This number proves that the
vessel was of considerable size. <i>La Blanche Nef</i> was a fifty-oared
galley. Long before her time, at the end of the tenth
century, when Ethelred the Unready was King of England,
the Viking Olaf Tryggvesson built, according to the Norwegian
chroniclers, a vessel 117 ft. in length.</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned that galleys continued to be used,
along with sailing ships, in the various European navies till the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Another instance of the loss of a large twelfth-century ship
occurred in the reign of Henry II., half a century later than
the wreck of <i>La Blanche Nef</i>, when a vessel engaged in transport
work foundered with 400 persons.</p>

<p>In the reign of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion a great impetus was
given to shipbuilding and to maritime adventure in this country
by the expedition which the king undertook to the Holy Land.
A fleet of about 110 vessels, according to Peter Langtoft,
sailed from Dartmouth in April, 1190 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> It was reinforced
considerably in the Mediterranean; for, according to Matthew
Paris, Richard was accompanied on his voyage to Palestine
by 13 buccas, 100 "ships of burthen," and 50 triremes, and
according to Vinesauf, the fleet consisted of about 230 vessels.
The buccas, or busses, or dromons, were ships of the largest
size, with triple sails. There were two sorts of galleys; some
were propelled by oars alone, and others by oars and sails:
the latter were the larger, and, according to Matthew Paris,
sometimes carried 60 men in armour, besides 104 rowers and
the sailors. He also states that some of them had triple banks
of oars like the ancient galleys; but, according to Vinesauf,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the majority had not more than two banks of oars, and carried
the traditional flying deck above the rowers for the use of the
soldiers; they were low in the water compared to the sailing-ships,
and they carried beaks, or rams, which, as narrated subsequently,
they used to some purpose.</p>

<p>The larger type of sailing-ships carried a captain and fifteen
sailors, forty knights with their horses, an equal number of
men-at-arms, fourteen servants, and complete stores for
twelve months. There were, moreover, three much larger
vessels in the fleet which carried double the complement
mentioned above.</p>

<p>As an instance of the very large size to which vessels occasionally
attained in those days in the Levant, we may refer
to a Saracen vessel which was attacked by Richard's fleet near
Beirut in Syria, in 1191. It was described by many of the
old chroniclers. This ship had three masts, and is alleged to
have had 1,500 men on board at the time of the fight. The
attack was carried out with great difficulty, on account of the
towering height of the sides of the Saracen vessel, and it was not
till ramming tactics were tried by the galleys charging in line
abreast, that her hull was stove in, in several places, and she
went down with nearly all hands, only thirty-five, or, according
to other accounts forty-six, having been saved.</p>

<p>These large ships appear to have been used by other Mediterranean
Powers towards the end of the twelfth century. For
instance, a great Venetian ship visited Constantinople in 1172
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, of which it was stated that "no vessel of so great a bulk
had ever been within that port." This vessel is mentioned by
Cinnamis, Marino, and Filiasi, and others, but her dimensions
are not given. It is, however, known that she had three masts.
Cinnamis, who was at Constantinople at this very time, states
that she received from 1,500 to 2,000 Venetian refugees on
board, and conveyed them to the Adriatic. The Venetians are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
said to have employed another very large ship at the
siege of Ancona in 1157 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> On account of its size it was
named <i>Il Mondo</i>.</p>

<p>The Republic of Venice was, during the time of which we
are writing, and for a long subsequent period, the foremost
maritime power of the world. It is highly probable that
many of the improvements which found their way into
medi&aelig;val ships owed their origin to its great naval arsenal,
which was famed for its resources and for the technical skill
of its employ&eacute;s. At one time this arsenal employed 16,000
workmen, and during the great struggle of the Republic with
the Turks at the end of the sixteenth century it turned out a
completed and fully equipped galley every day for a hundred
days in succession. During the Crusades, Venice and the
rival Republic of Genoa secured between them the great bulk
of the business involved in transporting troops and stores to
the East, and they frequently hired out their war and merchant
ships to other Powers.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Crusade of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion the trade
and shipping of England appear to have undergone great
expansion. In the reign of Henry III. (1216 to 1272) the
historian, Matthew of Westminster, writes of them in a strain
which might almost apply to our own day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Oh England, whose antient glory is renowned among all nations,
like the pride of the Chaldeans; the ships of Tarsis could not compare
with thy ships; they bring from all the quarters of the world aromatic
spices and all the most precious things of the universe: the sea is
thy wall, and thy ports are as the gates of a strong and well-furnished
castle."</p></div>

<p>In another place the same historian writes of the English
trade as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Pisans, Genoese, and Venetians supply England with the
Eastern gems, as saphires, emeralds, and carbuncles; from Asia was
brought the rich silks and purples; from Africa the cinnamon and
balm; from Spain the kingdom was enriched with gold; with silver
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>from Germany; from Flanders came the rich materials for the garments
of the people; while plentiful streams of wine flowed from their
own province of Gascoigny; joined with everything that was rich and
pretious from every land, wide stretching from the Hyades to the
Arcturian Star."</p></div>

<p>No doubt this expansion was due, in part, to the very large
participation which the English fleet took in the Crusade.
Great numbers of English mariners were thus enabled to
penetrate into seas that were new to them, and had opportunities
of studying the commercial needs of the countries
which bordered on those seas. Another cause which powerfully
contributed to the development of navigation, and
consequently of shipbuilding, was the introduction of the
mariner's compass into Western Europe during the first half
of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The English war navy, also at the commencement of the
reign of Henry II., appears to have been in a very efficient
condition. Matthew Paris gives a description of a great naval
fight off the South Foreland, in the year 1217, between a Cinque
Ports Fleet under the famous Hubert de Burgh, who was at
the time Governor of Dover Castle, and a large French fleet
under a monk of the name of Eustace, who was one of the most
skilful naval commanders of his day. The English fleet
consisted of forty vessels, of which only sixteen were large
and manned with trained sailors. The French fleet, which was
endeavouring to carry a strong invading army to England,
was made up of eighty large vessels, besides numerous galleys
and smaller craft. The account of the battle is most interesting,
because it throws a flood of light upon the naval tactics and
the weapons of offence of the day. The English commander
man&oelig;uvred for the wind, and having got it, he bore down
on the French fleet, and attacked their rear ships with flights
of arrows carrying phials of unslaked lime, which being
scattered and carried by the wind, blinded the Frenchmen;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
boarding was then attempted with perfect success, the rigging
and halyards of the French ships were cut away, causing the
sails to fall upon their crews. A hand-to-hand combat then
took place, which resulted in fearful slaughter of the would-be
invaders: several of the French ships were rammed and sunk
by the English galleys, and in the end the whole of the hostile
fleet, with the exception of fifteen vessels, was taken or sunk.
This was one of the most momentous naval battles in English
history, and is memorable as having furnished the first recorded
instance of a battle having been preceded by man&oelig;vres to
obtain the weather-gauge.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;Dover seal. 1284.</p></div>

<p>We have, unfortunately, very few illustrations of the
thirteenth-century ships, and those which we do possess are
taken from the corporate seals of some of the Cinque Ports
and other southern seaport towns. Fig. <a href="#f28">28</a> is a representation
of the seal of Sandwich, and dates from the year 1238. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
circular form of a seal is not very favourable for the representation
of a masted ship, but we can at least make out that
the vessel in question is of the Scandinavian type used by
William I. and his successors. It also appears to have been
an open boat, and contains the germs of the castellated
structures fore and aft, which, as we shall see afterwards,
attained to the most exaggerated dimensions. In the case
of the Sandwich ship these castles were not incorporated with
the structure of the vessel; they were merely elevated positions
for the use of the archers and men-at-arms, and were mounted
on columns, and were probably removable. We can also learn
from the engraving that the practice of furling sails aloft
was practised at that time. Fig. <a href="#f29">29</a> is the seal of Dover, and
dates from the reign of Edward I. (1284 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). It does not
show much progress over the Sandwich boat of nearly fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
years earlier, but we may notice that the castles are more
developed and of a more permanent character. This vessel
also possesses a bowsprit.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of this century that cabins appear
to have been introduced into English ships. The first mention
of them occurs in 1242, when orders were given that "decent
chambers" were to be constructed in a ship in which the king
and queen were to voyage to Gascony.</p>

<p>There are records in existence of the dimensions of some
vessels which were built for Louis IX. of France in the year
1268 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> at Venice and Genoa. They are published in Jal's
"Arch&eacute;ologie Navale." The Venetian ship which was named
the <i>Roccafortis</i> appears to have been the largest. Her dimensions
are given as follows: length of keel, 70 ft.; length over
all, 110 ft.; width at prow and poop, 40 ft. This latter
dimension is hardly credible. The <i>Roccafortis</i> had two
covered decks, and a castle or "bellatorium" at each end, and
also several cabins. The crew numbered 110.</p>

<p>The Genoese ships were smaller. Two of them were of identical
dimensions, viz. length of keel, 49&frac12; ft.; length over all,
75 ft.; beam, 10 ft. The figure given for the beam appears to
be too small in this case, if the dimensions of the mast, 70&frac12; ft.,
are correct, for such a long mast could hardly have been
carried in so narrow a boat. These vessels had two decks, and
are said to have had stabling for fifty horses each; but this
latter statement cannot be true if the dimensions are accurately
given.</p>

<p>We have very little information about the ships of the end of
the thirteenth and commencement of the fourteenth centuries.
There is a list in existence of Cinque Ports ships which were
fitted out in 1299 to take part in the war against Scotland.
They were thirty in number. More than half of them had
complements of two constables and thirty-nine mariners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and the smallest had one constable and nineteen mariners.
There is also a statement of the tonnage and complements
of ships intended for an expedition to Guienne in the year
1324, which throws some light on the size of the vessels
employed in the Scottish expedition. From it we learn that
a ship of 240 tons had 60 mariners and officers; one of 200
tons, 50; vessels between 160 and 180 tons, 40; of 140 tons,
35; of 120 tons, 28; of 100 tons, 26; of 80 tons, 24; and
of 60 tons, 21. From the above we may infer that the largest
vessels in the Cinque Ports' squadron of 1,299 were from 160
to 180 tons. The measure of a ton in those early days was
probably the cubic space occupied by a tun of wine of 252
gallons in the hold of a ship.</p>

<p>We possess one representation of an English ship of the date
of this expedition to Guienne. It was engraved on the seal of
the Port of Poole in the year 1325 (Fig. <a href="#f30">30</a>). It is remarkable
as the earliest known instance of an English ship fitted with a
rudder at the stern instead of the side-rudder, or paddle, which
had been in use from the very earliest times. We also notice
in this ship a further development of the stern and forecastles,
which, however, were not as yet fully incorporated with the
structure of the hull.</p>

<p>The reign of Edward III., which commenced in 1327, was, in
consequence of the wars with Scotland and France, one of great
naval activity. After some years of desultory naval warfare
in the Channel, a famous sea fight took place at Sluys, in Dutch
Flanders, about ten miles north-east of Blankenberghe, in the
year 1340. The English fleet consisted of about 200 ships
under the personal command of Edward III. The allied
French and Genoese fleet numbered, according to the English
king, 190, and was composed of ships, galleys, and barges,
while some of the chroniclers have put its numbers at as many
as 400 sail, but this would probably include many small craft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
The battle resulted in the capture, or destruction, of nearly
the whole French fleet. The English are said to have lost
4,000 men killed, and the French 25,000. In one vessel, named
the <i>Jeanne de Dieppe</i>, captured by the Earl of Huntingdon, no
fewer than 400 dead bodies were found. The latter figure
shows that some very large vessels were used at this battle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="f30" id="f30"></a><img src="images/fig30.png" width="400" height="349"
alt="Poole seal. 1325." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;Poole seal. 1325.</p></div>

<p>Edward III. caused a gold noble to be struck in 1344 bearing
the representation of a ship almost precisely similar to the
vessel on the seal of Poole, of about twenty years earlier
(Fig. <a href="#f30">30</a>). It is fitted with a rudder at the stern, and we may
therefore conclude that at this period the side-rudder, or
clavus, had disappeared from all important vessels. The
fore and stern castles were, in most cases, temporary additions
to merchant ships, to adapt them for purposes of warfare.
In fact, nearly all the sailing-ships used in naval warfare down
to, and even after the fourteenth century, appear to have been
employed as merchant vessels in time of peace; and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
remark applies even to the king's ships. It was, no doubt, the
introduction of artillery that first caused the sailing warship to
be differentiated from the merchantman. Although gunpowder
for military purposes is said to have been used on land
as early as 1326, and although iron and brass cannon are
mentioned amongst the stores of three of the king's ships
in 1338, nevertheless, the battle of Sluys and the subsequent
naval engagements in the reign of Edward III. appear to have
been fought without artillery. It was not till the last quarter
of the fourteenth century that guns became at all common on
board ship.</p>

<p>In the year 1345 Edward III. invaded France, and was
accompanied by a fleet of from 1,000 to 1,100 ships, besides
small craft. Two hundred of these vessels were employed
after the king's landing in ravaging the northern coasts of
France and destroying the hostile shipping.</p>

<p>In the year 1347 Edward organised another great naval
expedition against France, this time in order to give him the
command of the sea during his siege of Calais. The fleet was
drawn from all the ports of the kingdom, and small contingents
came from Ireland, Flanders, Spain, and the king's own
possession of Bayonne. There are two lists in existence of the
numbers of ships and men contributed by each port to this
expedition. They agree very closely. According to one of
them, the united fleet consisted of 745 ships, and 15,895
mariners, or an average of about twenty mariners to each
ship. This figure, of course, does not include the fighting
men. About fifty of these vessels were fighting ships fitted
with castles, and the remainder were barges, ballingers (which
appear to have been a kind of large barge), and transports.
The largest contingents, by far, came from Yarmouth, which
contributed 43 ships and 1,950 men; Fowey sent 47 ships and
770 men; and Dartmouth supplied 32 ships and 756 men;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
while London, independently of the king's own vessels, sent
only 25 ships manned with 662 men.</p>

<p>In 1350 Edward III. and the Black Prince fought a famous
naval battle off Winchelsea against a fleet of forty Spanish ships.
The battle is generally known by the name of L'Espagnols-sur-Mer.
Edward was victorious, though he lost his own ship,
through its springing a leak when colliding with one of the
Spanish vessels. The tactics of the English consisted chiefly of
boarding, while the Spaniards, whose vessels were much the
higher, attacked with cross-bows and heavy stones; the latter
they hurled from their fighting-tops into their adversaries' ships.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, we can infer that the naval resources of
England in the first half of the reign of Edward III. were very
great. During the latter half of his reign he neglected his navy,
and the French and Spaniards, in spite of all their previous
losses, rapidly gained the upper hand at sea, and ravaged the
English coasts. In 1372 the Spanish fleet assisting the French
inflicted a severe defeat upon an inferior English squadron
which had been sent to the relief of La Rochelle. This battle is
memorable because it was, probably, the first sea-fight in which
artillery was employed, the Spanish ships having been partly
armed with the new weapon. The Venetians are usually
credited with having been the first people to employ naval
guns; but we do not find them using artillery against the
Genoese till the year 1377.</p>

<p>The introduction of cannon as the armament of ships of war
was the cause of several modifications in the construction of
their hulls. Most of the early vessels fitted with cannon were
of the galley type, the guns being mounted on the upper deck,
and fired over the bulwarks, <i>en barbette</i>. Afterwards portholes
were cut through the bulwarks. Fig. <a href="#f31">31</a> represents a
Venetian galley of the fourteenth century, as given by Charnock,
with a single gun mounted in the bow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f31" id="f31"></a><img src="images/fig31.png" width="500" height="320"
alt="Venetian galley. Fourteenth century." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap"> Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Venetian galley. Fourteenth century.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>The new form of armament of ships involved a considerable
raising of the height of side, and in order to counteract the
effect of the high topside, carrying the weight of guns aloft, the
beam of the vessel relatively to its length had to be much increased.
The Venetians were, however, afraid to make the transverse
section wide throughout, lest the weight of the guns near
the sides of the vessel should cause the connection of the sides
with the beams to strain; hence they gave the sides considerable
"tumble home," or fall inboard, as represented by Fig. <a href="#f32">32</a>,
which shows the cross-section of a Venetian galleon. It will
be noticed that the width of the upper deck is only about half
that of the greatest beam. This practice was afterwards carried
to an absurd extent by the Venetians and their imitators,
even in cases where guns were not carried aloft, as may be seen
from the sketch of a galleon given in Fig. <a href="#f33">33</a>. Hence it is
evident that the introduction of ordnance on board ship
accounted for a complete revolution in the proportions of
hulls hitherto in vogue. The rig of ships also underwent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
considerable development about this period. The old single
mast of the galley was supplemented by two and in some cases
by three others. The sails were still square sails carried on
spars, and the practice of reefing the sails to the spars
aloft, instead of lowering spars and sails together on deck,
had now become common.</p>

alt="Cross-section of a Venetian galleon." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;Cross-section of a Venetian galleon.</p></div>

<p>Two years after the action off La Rochelle we find the French
commencing the construction of a Royal Navy at Rouen.
This step was taken in consequence of the strong opinion
held by Jean de Vienne, who was appointed Admiral of
France in 1373, that vessels built specially for the purposes
of war would have a great advantage over the hired merchantmen
which had to be adapted for fighting each time they were
impressed.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that the latter half of the fourteenth
century witnessed many improvements in ships built in the
Mediterranean. This was no doubt due, in part, to the intense
commercial rivalry that existed at that time between Venice
and the other Italian Republics. Fig. <a href="#f34">34</a> is taken from a
MS. Virgil in the Riccardi Library, reproduced in M. Jal's<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
work. It represents an Italian two-masted sailing-ship of
this period. This is one of the earliest illustrations of a ship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>with a permanent forecastle forming part of the structure
of the vessel. The stern castle also appears to have a permanent,
though not a structural character. Ships of somewhat
similar type were used in England in the reign of Richard
II. at the end of the fourteenth century. Fig. <a href="#f34">35</a> represents
one of them, the original being in an illustrated manuscript
in the Harleian Library. It was written by a Frenchman of
the name of Francis de la Marque in Richard's reign. There
are illustrations in manuscripts still in existence written
about this period, which confirm the fact that this type of
ship was then prevalent.</p>

<p>The reign of Henry V. (1413 to 1422) was one of great naval
development. The king himself took a most ardent interest in
the Royal Navy, and frequently inspected the ships during
their construction. Under his auspices some very large
vessels were built for the fleet. Lists of this king's ships are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
still in existence. They are classified under the names
Great Ships, Cogs, Carracks, Ships, Barges, and Ballingers.
The largest of the great ships was the <i>Jesus</i>, of 1,000 tons;
the <i>Holigost</i>, of 760; the <i>Trinity Royal</i>, of 540; and the
<i>Christopher Spayne</i>, of 600; the last-mentioned was a prize
captured by the Earl of Huntingdon. The majority of the
ships were, however, from 420 to 120 tons. The carracks were
apparently not English-built ships, as all those in the king's
navy were prizes captured in 1416 and 1417. The three
largest were of 600, 550, and 500 tons respectively. The
barges are given as of 100 tons, and the ballingers ranged
from 120 to 80 tons. The total strength of the Royal Navy
about the year 1420, as given in the list compiled by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
W. M. Oppenheim from the accounts of the keepers of the
king's ships, is 38; of these 17 were ships, 7 carracks, 2
barges, and 12 ballingers. It is worthy of notice that there
were no galleys included in the list.</p>

<p>Henry invaded France in 1415 with a fleet of 1,400 vessels,
which had been raised by impressing every British ship of
20 tons and upwards. The home supply not being sufficient
for his purpose, Henry sent commissioners to Holland and
Zealand to hire additional vessels. In all 1,500 ships were
collected and 1,400 utilised. These figures give us a fair idea
of the resources of this country in shipping at that time.</p>

<p>This was the invasion which resulted in the victory of
Agincourt and the capture of Harfleur. In the year following
(1416) France was again invaded and the fleet was stated
by some to have numbered 300, and by others 400 ships.
A naval battle was fought off Harfleur. It resulted in a
complete victory for Henry. The old tactics and the old
weapons seem to have been used. Although, as we have
seen, guns had been used in sea-fights nearly forty years
previously, there is no mention of their having been employed
on either side at this battle.</p>

<p>In 1417 the king again collected 1,500 vessels at Southampton
for a fresh invasion of France. Having first obtained the
command of the sea by a naval victory over the French and
Genoese, a landing was duly effected near Harfleur. Several
vessels, including four large carracks, were captured in the
sea-fight, and were added to the king's navy.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry V. the Mercantile Marine of
England made no progress. Commerce was checked in
consequence of the state of war which prevailed, and the
improvements in shipbuilding seem to have been confined to
the Royal Navy. It seems probable, however, that the
experience gained in the construction and navigation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
very large ships which the king added to the navy had its
effect, ultimately, in improving the type of merchant-vessels.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;English ship. Time of Henry VI.</p></div>

<p>During the forty years of the reign of Henry VI. England
was so greatly exhausted and impoverished by war with
France and by internal dissensions at home, that commerce
and shipbuilding made little progress. We possess
a sketch of a ship of the early part of the reign of Henry VI.
It is contained in a manuscript in the Harleian Library of the
date, probably, of 1430 to 1435. It is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#f36">36</a>,
and differs from the ship of the reign of Richard II. shown in

developed.</p>

<p>While England was steadily declining in power from the time
of the death of Henry V., a new maritime nation was arising in
South-Western Europe, whose discoveries were destined to
have a most marked effect on the seaborne commerce, and
consequently on the shipbuilding of the world. In the year
1417 the Portuguese, under the guidance of Prince Henry the
Navigator, commenced their exploration of the west coast of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Africa, and they continued it with persistency during the
century. In 1418 they discovered, or rather re-discovered, the
island of Madeira, for it is extremely probable that it was
first visited by an Englishman of the name of Machin.</p>

<p>The Portuguese prince firmly believed that a route could be
opened round Africa to the Indies. To reach these regions by
sea seems to have been the goal of the great explorers of the
fifteenth century, and the Portuguese were stimulated in their
endeavours by a grant from Pope Martin V. of all territories
which might thenceforward be discovered between Cape
Bojador and the East Indies. In 1446 an expedition consisting
of six caravels was fitted out, and made a voyage
to Guinea; it resulted in the discovery of the Cape Verde
Islands. The caravel was a type of ship much used by the
countries of Southern Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. A description of a Spanish vessel of this type is
given on pages 87 to 89. In 1449 the Azores were discovered.
In 1481 a lucrative trade was opened up between Portugal
and the natives of Guinea. Six years afterwards the Cape
of Good Hope was reached by Bartholomew Diaz, and in
1497 it was doubled by Vasco da Gama.</p>

<p>During a great part of the period in which the Portuguese
were thus occupied in extending their commerce and in paving
the way for great discoveries, the condition of England, owing
to the French war and to the subsequent Wars of the Roses,
was passing from bad to worse. Nevertheless, the spirit
of commercial enterprise was not wholly extinguished. A
few merchants seem to have made fortunes in the shipping
trade, and among them may be mentioned the famous William
Canynge of Bristol, who was probably the greatest private shipowner
in England at the end of the reign of Henry VI. and
during the time of Edward IV. (1461 to 1483). Canynge
traded to Iceland, Finland, and the Mediterranean. He is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
said to have possessed ships as large as 900 tons, and it is
recorded on his monument, in the church of St. Mary Redcliffe,
in Bristol, that he at one time lent ships, to the extent
of 2,670 tons, to Edward IV. It is also related of him that
he owned ten ships and employed 800 sailors and 100 artisans.</p>

<p>It was not till the year 1475, upon the conclusion of peace
between Edward and the French king, Louis, that affairs
quieted down in England, and then trade and commerce made
most marvellous progress. The king himself was one of the
leading merchants of the country, and concluded treaties of
commerce with Denmark, Brittany, Castile, Burgundy, France,
Zealand, and the Hanseatic League. In the reign of Edward's
successor, Richard III., English seaborne trade obtained a
firm footing in Italy and other Mediterranean countries.</p>

<p>We, fortunately, possess drawings which show that an
enormous advance was made in shipbuilding during the period
under discussion, or that, at any rate, the advance had by
that time reached England. Fig. <a href="#f37">37</a> illustrates a large ship
of the latter half of the fifteenth century. It is taken from a
manuscript in the Cottonian Library, by John Rous, the
celebrated Warwickshire antiquary and historian. This
manuscript records the life and history of Richard Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, who was born in 1381, and died in 1439. The
author of the manuscript, however, lived till 1491, in the early
part of the reign of Henry VII., and we may therefore conclude
that the illustrations represent ships of the latter half of the
fifteenth century. The vessel shown in Fig. <a href="#f37">37</a> was used
for war purposes, as four guns were mounted on the broadside.
There were also four masts and a bowsprit, and a strongly
developed forecastle, which formed part of the structure of the
ship. There was apparently very luxurious accommodation
provided for passengers and officers in a large deck-house at
the poop. The mainsail was of very large dimensions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
was emblazoned with the arms of the Earl of Warwick. In
this illustration we see an early approach to the modern type
of sailing-ship. There are several other drawings of ships in
the same manuscripts, and most of them have the same
general characteristics as Fig. <a href="#f37">37</a>.</p>

<p>The reign of Henry VII. (1485 to 1509) was a memorable
one in the annals of navigation and commerce. Two years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
after he came to the throne, the Portuguese sent the expedition,
previously referred to, to discover a route to the Indies round
Africa. The expedition never reached its destination, but
Diaz succeeded in discovering the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>&mdash;Columbus' ship, the <i>Santa Maria</i>, 1492.</p></div>

<p>A few years later, in 1492, Christopher Columbus made his
famous attempt to reach the Indies by sailing west. This
expedition, as is well known, resulted in the discovery of the
West Indian Islands, and, shortly afterwards, of the mainland
of America. The ships which Columbus took with him
on his voyage were three in number, and small in size. As
Spain had possessed many large vessels for a century and a
half before the time of Columbus, it is probable that he was
entrusted with small ships only, because the Government
did not care to risk much capital in so adventuresome an
undertaking.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Sail-plan of the <i>Santa Maria</i>.</p></div>

<p>Fortunately, we have a fairly exact knowledge of the form
and dimensions of the caravel <i>Santa Maria</i>, which was the
largest of the three vessels. She was reconstructed in 1892-93<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
at the arsenal of Carraca, by Spanish workmen, under the
superintendence of Se&ntilde;or Leopold Wilke, for the Chicago
Exhibition of 1893. Se&ntilde;or Wilke had access to every known
source of information. Figs. 38 to 40 give a general view, sail-plan
and lines, of this ship as reconstructed.</p>

<p>The following were her leading dimensions:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>Santa Maria</i>, like most vessels of her time, was provided
with an extensive forecastle, which overhung the stem nearly
12 ft. She had also an enormous structure aft, consisting of
half and quarter decks above the main deck. She had three
masts and a bowsprit. The latter and the fore and main masts
were square-rigged, and the mizzen was lateen-rigged. The
outside of the hull was strengthened with vertical and longitudinal
timber beams.</p>

<p>The <i>Santa Maria</i>, as reproduced, was sailed across the
Atlantic from Spain by Captain D. V. Concas and a Spanish
crew in the year 1893. The course taken was exactly the
same as that followed by Columbus on his first voyage. The
time occupied was thirty-six days, and the maximum speed
attained was about 6&frac12; knots. The vessel pitched horribly.</p>

<p>In 1497 the first English expedition was made to America
under John Cabot. We have no particulars of the ship in which
Cabot sailed, but it could not have been a large one, as it is
known that the crew only numbered eighteen. The expedition
sailed from Bristol in the month of May, and land, which was
probably Cape Breton, was sighted on June 24. Bristol was
reached on the return journey at the end of July. In the
following year Cabot made another voyage, and explored the
coast of North America from Cape Breton to as far south as
Cape Hatteras. Many other expeditions in the same direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
were fitted out in the last years of the fifteenth and the first
years of the sixteenth centuries.</p>


<p>While Cabot was returning from his first voyage to North
America, one of the most famous and most epoch-making
expeditions of discovery of modern times was fitted out in
Portugal. On July 24, 1497, Vasco da Gama set sail from the
Tagus in the hope of reaching India <i>via</i> the Cape of Good
Hope. His squadron consisted of three ships, named the
<i>San Gabriel</i>, the <i>San Raphael</i>, and the <i>Birrio</i>, together with a
transport to carry stores. There is a painting in existence at
Lisbon of the <i>San Gabriel</i>, which is supposed to be authentic.
It represents her as having a high poop and forecastle, very
like the caravel <i>Santa Maria</i>. She had four masts and a
bowsprit. The latter and the fore and main masts were
square-rigged. The <i>San Gabriel</i> was, however, a much larger
vessel than the <i>Santa Maria</i>. She is said to have been constructed
to carry 400 pipes of wine. This would be equivalent
to about 400 tons measurement, or, from 250 to 300 tons
register.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The other two ships selected were of about the same
dimensions, and of similar equipment and rig, in order that, in
the event of losses, or accidents, each of the ships might make
use of any of the spars, tackle, or fittings belonging to the others.</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned that the ships reached Quilimane,
on the east coast of South Africa, on January 22, 1498. After
many visits to East African ports, during which they satisfied
themselves that the arts of navigation were as well understood
by the Eastern seamen as by themselves, they set sail for India
early in August, and after a voyage of twenty, or, as some say,
twenty-three days, they sighted the coast, and shortly afterwards
arrived in Calicut, nearly fourteen months after they
started from Lisbon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
About this time the Memlook Sultans of Egypt absolutely
cut off the trade which had been carried on for centuries
between the Italian Republics and the Malabar coast of India
<i>via</i> the overland route and the Red Sea. It was this fact that
gave the discovery of the sea-route to India such enormous
importance, and, ultimately, it was one of the causes of the
commercial downfall of the Italian Republics. The Cape route
became the great high-road of commerce to the East, and
remained so down to the present reign, when the re-establishment
of the overland route, and, eventually, the successful
cutting of the Suez Canal, restored commerce to its old paths.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Columbus, Vasco da Gama, John Cabot,
and their successors, had an enormous influence upon shipbuilding,
as they not only widened the area of seaborne
commerce, but offered strong inducements to navigators to
venture on the great oceans, far from land, in craft specially
adapted for such voyages. Hitherto, sailors had either
navigated the great inland seas of Europe or had engaged
in the coasting trade, and the longest voyages undertaken
before the end of the fifteenth century were probably those
which English merchants made between Bristol and Iceland,
and between our Eastern ports and Bergen.</p>

<p>Henry VII. not only encouraged commerce and voyages of
discovery, but also paid great attention to the needs of the
Royal Navy. He added two warships to his fleet, which were
more powerful vessels than any previously employed in this
country. One of them, named the <i>Regent</i>, was copied from a
French ship of 600 tons, and was built on the Rother about
1490. She carried four masts and a bowsprit, and was armed
with 225 small guns, called serpentines. The second ship
was named the <i>Sovereign</i>, and it is remarkable, as showing the
connection at that time between land and naval architecture,
that she was built under the superintendence of Sir Reginald<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Bray, who was also the architect of Henry VII.'s Chapel at
Westminster Abbey, and of St. George's Chapel, Windsor.
The <i>Sovereign</i> carried 141 serpentines.</p>

<p>The <i>Regent</i> was burnt in an action off Brest in the reign of
Henry VIII., in the year 1512. She caught fire from a large
French carrack, called the <i>Marie la Cordeli&egrave;re</i>, which she was
attacking. Both ships were utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>The <i>Marie la Cordeli&egrave;re</i> was probably the largest warship of
her time. She is said to have carried 1,200 men, and to have
lost 900 killed in the action. She was built at Morlaix at the
sole cost of Anne of Brittany, then Queen of France.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;The <i>Henry Grace &agrave; Dieu</i>. <i>Pepysian Library, Cambridge.</i></p></div>

<p>The <i>Regent</i> was replaced by a very famous ship called the
<i>Henry Grace &agrave; Dieu</i>, otherwise known as the <i>Great Harry</i>. As
a consequence, most probably, of the size and force of some of
the French ships, as revealed in the action off Brest, the <i>Henry
Grace &agrave; Dieu</i> was a great advance on any previous British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
warship. She was built at Erith, and was probably launched
in June, 1514. Her tonnage is given in a manuscript in
Pepys' "Miscellanies" as 1,500; but it is generally believed
that she did not in reality exceed 1,000 tons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f42" id="f42"></a><img src="images/fig42.png" width="500" height="368"

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;The <i>Henry Grace &agrave; Dieu</i>. <i>After Allen.</i></p></div>

<p>There are more drawings than one in existence, supposed
to represent this famous warship. One of them, shown in
Fig. <a href="#f41">41</a>, is from a drawing in the Pepysian Library, in Magdalene
College, Cambridge. Another, shown in Fig. <a href="#f42">42</a>, is from
an engraving by Allen of a picture ascribed to Holbein. The
two illustrations differ in many important respects and
cannot both represent the same ship. There is very little
doubt that Fig. <a href="#f41">41</a> is the more correct representation of the
two, because it is confirmed in all essential respects by Volpe's
picture of the embarkation of Henry VIII. at Dover in 1520 on
this very ship. Volpe's picture is now at Hampton Court
Palace, and shows four other ships of the Royal Navy, which
were all built in the same style as the Pepysian drawing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Fig. <a href="#f41">41</a>, with enormous forecastles and poops. The vessel
represented in the picture ascribed to Holbein appears to belong
to a later date than 1520, and is, in fact, transitional between
the ships of this period and those of the reign of Elizabeth.
One of the warships of the latter period is shown in Fig. <a href="#f45">45</a>.</p>

<p>According to a manuscript, in the Pepysian Collection, the
<i>Henry Grace &agrave; Dieu</i> was armed with twenty-one guns and a
multitude of smaller pieces. The numbers of the various guns
and the weights of their shot are given in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sizes of the guns of this time are pretty accurately
known, because one of the ships of Henry VIII., called the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, built in 1509, went down off Portsmouth in 1545,
and several of her guns have been recovered, and are still in
existence.</p>

<p>The por-holes were circular, and so small in diameter that
no traverse could have been given to the guns. This practice
continued to prevail till the time of the Commonwealth.
There were five masts in this, as in all other first-rates henceforth
down to the time of Charles I. One of the masts was
inclined forward, like a modern bowsprit. Each mast was
made in one piece, the introduction of separate topmasts
having been a more modern improvement.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43</span>&mdash;Genoese carrack. 1542.</p></div>

<p>The highest development in the art of shipbuilding at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
period was reached in the large merchant-ships called Carracks.
The competition between the great trading republics
of Italy, viz. Venice and Genoa, and the rivalry of Portugal
probably accounted for the marked improvement in the
character of merchant-ships in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. Fig. <a href="#f43">43</a> gives a representation of a large Genoese
carrack of the sixteenth century. It will be noticed that this
vessel had four masts, and was square-rigged, the foremost mast
having been inclined forward somewhat after the fashion of the
modern bowsprit. In the sixteenth century the carrack
often attained the size of 1,600 tons. Towards the latter
half of this century a Portuguese carrack captured by the
English was, in length, from the beakhead to the stern, 165 ft.;
beam, 47 ft.; length of keel, 100 ft.; height of mainmast,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
121 ft.; circumference at partners, 11 ft.; length of mainyard,
106 ft.; burthen, 1,600 tons. This vessel carried 32 pieces
of brass ordnance&mdash;a very necessary addition to the merchant-ship
of the period&mdash;and accommodated between 600 and 700
passengers.</p>

<p>The most important maritime event in the sixteenth century
was, undoubtedly, the fitting out by Spain, in 1588, of the
gigantic expedition intended to invade this country in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth. An account of the fleets on either
side may therefore be interesting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f44" id="f44"></a>
<img src="images/fig44.png" width="500" height="245"
alt="Spanish galleass. 1588." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>&mdash;Spanish galleass. 1588.</p></div>

<p>The great Armada consisted of no less than 132 vessels, of
which only four were galleys, and four galleasses.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Of the
remainder, 30 were under 100 tons, and 94 were between 130
and 1,550 tons. The total tonnage of the ships, less the galleys
and galleasses, was 59,120. The armament consisted of 2,761<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
guns. The seamen numbered 7,865 and the soldiers 20,671.
The fleet was divided into ten squadrons. The largest vessel
was the flagship of the Levant squadron, and was of 1,249 tons,
and carried 30 guns. The crew consisted of 80 sailors and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>344 soldiers. The next largest was of 1,200 tons and carried 47
guns, but the greater number of the vessels were much smaller.
The popular belief as to their incredible size and unwieldiness
must therefore be dismissed as baseless, for even the largest
ships were far exceeded in size by some of the carracks, or
merchant vessels, of that day. On the average the Spanish
vessels mounted 22 guns apiece, and carried crews of 231
sailors and soldiers. Fig. <a href="#f44">44</a> is a sketch, taken from the
tapestry of the old House of Lords, of one of the galleasses
of the fleet. It will be noticed that she carried her guns
extremely high, a peculiarity which was common to many of
the Spanish vessels; for we read that their fire did more harm
to the rigging than to the hulls of the English vessels.</p>

<p>The fleet mustered by Elizabeth was far more numerous, but
its tonnage did not amount to one-half of that of the Armada.
The total number of vessels sailing under the English flag was
197, of which, however, only 34 belonged to the Royal Navy.
The remainder were merchant vessels, hastily fitted out and
adapted for purposes of war by their owners, or by the ports
to which they belonged. Of the Royal ships the largest was
the <i>Triumph</i>, built in 1561. She was commanded by Sir
Martin Frobisher, and was only exceeded in size by four of the
Spanish vessels. The <i>Triumph</i> was between 1,000 and 1,100
tons, but there were only seven ships in the English Navy of
between 600 and 1,000 tons, whereas the Spaniards had no
fewer than 45. The crew of the <i>Triumph</i> numbered 500, of
whom 300 were sailors, 40 gunners, and 160 soldiers.</p>

<p>The <i>Triumph</i> carried 42 guns, of which 4 were cannon,
3 demi-cannon, 17 culverins, 8 demi-culverins, 6 sakers, and
4 small pieces. The greatest number of guns carried by any
ship in the fleet was 56, mounted on board the <i>Elizabeth Jones</i>,
of 900 tons, and built in 1559. The flagship of the Lord High
Admiral, Lord Howard of Effingham, the <i>Ark</i>, was the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
modern of the English warships, having been built in 1587.
She was of 800 tons, carried a crew of 430, and mounted 55
guns.</p>

<p>Of the merchant auxiliaries the two largest were the <i>Galleon
Leicester</i> and the <i>Merchant Royal</i>, each of 400 tons, and each
carried a crew of 160 men. In the former of these the explorer
Cavendish afterwards made his last voyage. Another of the
merchant-ships, the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i>, belonged to the
Levant Company, and in the years 1591 to 1593 was distinguished
as the first English ship that made a successful
voyage to India.</p>

<p>The size of a large number of the merchant-ships was under
100 tons. The total number of the crews of the entire English
fleet was 15,551; of these 6,289 belonged to the queen's ships.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the English ships in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, both in the Royal Navy and in the Mercantile
Marine, were much inferior in size to the vessels belonging to
the great Maritime Republics of Italy and to Spain and
Portugal. Hitherto the practice had been general of hiring
Genoese and Venetian carracks for mercantile purposes. It
is stated that about the year 1578, or twenty years after
Queen Elizabeth's accession to the throne, there were only 24
ships in the Royal Navy and 135 of above 100 tons burthen
in the whole kingdom, and but 656 that exceeded 40 tons.
Nevertheless, in this reign there was a great development of
mercantile activity, in which the sovereign as well as her people
participated. Many trading expeditions were sent out to the
West Indies and to North America, and warlike descents on
the Spanish ports were frequently carried out, and were
attended with great success. In Elizabeth's time the first
British colony, Virginia, was founded in North America, and
Sir Francis Drake undertook his memorable and eventful
voyage round the world in a squadron, which consisted, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
commencement, of five vessels, whereof the largest, the
<i>Pelican</i>, was of only 100 tons burthen, and the smallest a
pinnace of 15 tons. So great was the progress made about
this time in English maritime trade that, only four years
after the date above mentioned, there were said to have been
no less than 135 English commercial vessels of above 500 tons
in existence.</p>

<p>In the year 1587 Drake, in his famous marauding expedition
in the Spanish seas, captured a great carrack called the <i>San
Felipe</i>, which was returning home from the East Indies. The
papers found in her revealed the enormous profits which the
Spaniards made out of their trade with India, and afforded
such valuable information that the English merchant adventurers
were incited to cut in and try to secure some share
of this trade for themselves. This led, ultimately, to the
founding of the celebrated East India Company, and to the
conquest of India by the British. In 1589 certain merchants
petitioned the queen to grant them a licence to trade with the
East Indies; but Elizabeth, fearing the resentment of the
Spanish and Portuguese, would not grant their request for many
years, and it was not till the last day of the year 1599 that she
gave a charter of incorporation to the Earl of Cumberland and
215 knights and merchants for fifteen years, and thus founded
the first East India Company. English adventurers, however,
did not wait for a charter before commencing their trading
operations with the East, for in 1591 an expedition consisting
of three ships was sent out under the command of James
Lancaster. Only one of the three&mdash;the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i>,
which, as already mentioned, had been a merchant auxiliary
in the English fleet that opposed the Armada&mdash;ever reached
the East Indies in safety.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the charter had been granted Lancaster
led another expedition to the East. His fleet consisted of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
five ships; the largest, the <i>Dragon</i>, was of 600 tons, and had a
crew of 202. After an adventurous voyage the fleet returned
to England in September, 1602, having been absent two years
and eight months.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence to show that foreign merchant
ships in Elizabeth's reign were often much larger than any
built in this country. The following are examples. In 1592 a
Portuguese carrack called the <i>Madre de Dios</i> was captured and
brought home. She was of 1,600 tons burthen, 165 feet long
from stem to stern, and had seven decks, including the numerous
half and quarter decks which formed the poop. In 1594 a
Spanish carrack was destroyed which had 1,100 men on board.
When Cadiz was taken in 1596 two Spanish galleons of 1,200
tons were captured, and the flagship, the <i>San Felipe</i>, of 1,500
tons, was blown up. In 1602 a Portuguese carrack of 1,600
tons was captured at Cezimbra. She was named the <i>San
Valentino</i>, and was worth, with her cargo, a million ducats.</p>

<p>The system of striking topmasts appears to have been introduced
into the English Navy in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
It is mentioned by Sir Walter Raleigh as a recent improvement
and "a wonderful ease to great ships, both at sea and in the
harbour." Amongst the other novelties mentioned by the
same authority was the use of chain-pumps on board ship;
they lifted twice the amount of water that the old-fashioned
pumps could raise; studding, top-gallant, sprit and topsails
were also introduced, and the weighing of anchors by means of
the capstan. He also alludes to the recent use of long cables,
and says that "by it we resist the malice of the greatest winds
that can blow." The early men-of-war, pierced with portholes,
carried their lower guns very near the water. In some
cases there were only fourteen inches from the lower sill of the
portholes to the water-line. This practice led to many accidents;
amongst others may be mentioned the loss of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
<i>Mary Rose</i>, one of the largest ships in the Royal Navy in the
time of Henry VIII. Sir Walter Raleigh mentions that, in his
time, the practice was introduced of raising the lower tier of
ports. Nevertheless, this improvement did not become
general till the time of the restoration of Charles II. Fig. <a href="#f45">45</a>
is a representation of an English ship of war of the time of
Queen Elizabeth, supposed to be of the date 1588. It is
copied from the tapestries of the old House of Lords. It
shows clearly the recently introduced topmasts alluded to
by Sir Walter Raleigh. It is certainly a much more ship-shaped
and serviceable craft than the vessels of Henry VIII.
There is also in existence a drawing of a smaller Elizabethan
warship in the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian Library;
in essential particulars, it confirms Fig. <a href="#f45">45</a>. Both of these
show that the forecastles and poops had been considerably
modified.</p>

<p>Another great naval war was waged in the latter half of the
sixteenth century, about sixteen years before the defeat of the
Spanish Armada. The scene was the Adriatic Sea, and the
combatants were Venice, with her allies, Spain and the Papal
States, on the one hand, and the Turks on the other. It culminated
in the complete defeat of the latter at Lepanto in 1571.
The site of the battle of Lepanto is very near to that of Actium,
and it is a remarkable circumstance that twice in history a
decisive naval battle between the West and East should have
been decided at the same spot. The allies possessed a fleet
consisting of 208 galleys and 6 galleasses. The Venetians
introduced the latter type of vessel in order to meet the Turks
on even terms. It was an improved form of galley with three
masts, carrying several guns on the broadside, most of them
mounted on the upper deck. Fig. <a href="#f46">46</a> represents one of the
Venetian galleasses as used at the battle of Lepanto, to the
winning of which engagement they are said to have contributed
materially. The galleass was essentially a Mediterranean
warship. It was never generally adopted by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Western powers, but four Neapolitan vessels of this category,
carrying each 50 guns, formed a part of the great Armada sent
by Spain to effect the conquest of England. The galleass
represented in Fig. <a href="#f46">46</a> had a circular forecastle in which were
mounted several guns, to be used in end-on attack.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read the accounts of the battle of Lepanto
and of the defeat of the Spanish Armada without noticing the
great contrast between the ships used in the two wars at about
the same period. In the Mediterranean the single-banked
galley was still the prevailing type, while in the Western and
Northern seas the bulk of the Spanish and the whole of the
British fleets were sailing-ships.</p>

<p>It does not appear that any further novelties, or improvements,
worth alluding to were introduced into the practice of
shipbuilding till the accession of the House of Stuart in 1603.
All the monarchs of this family paid particular attention to
the development of the Royal Navy. King James I. had in
his service an educated naval architect of the name of Phineas
Pett, who was a Master of Arts of Emmanuel College, Cambridge,
and a member of a famous family of shipbuilders who
had been employed for two centuries previously, from father to
son, as officers and architects in the Royal Navy. Some time
after the accession of James, a Royal Commission inquired into
the general state and management of the navy, and issued
a report in 1618, which was in effect "a project for contracting
the charge of His Majesty's Navy, keeping the coast of England
and Ireland safely guarded, and his Majesty's ships in harbour
as sufficiently guarded as now they are, provided that the
old debts be paid, ... and certain assignments settled
for the further payment of the navy quarterly." At the time
the report was issued there were only seventeen vessels in the
navy which had been built during the reign of James. The
most important of these was the <i>Prince Royal</i>, built in 1610,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>and, at the time, considered to be one of the finest men-of-war
in the world. Fig. <a href="#f47">47</a> is an illustration of a man-of-war of the
period, which, there is strong evidence for believing, was this
very vessel. It was designed and built under the superintendence
of Phineas Pett at Woolwich Dockyard, and was given
by the king to his son Henry, Prince of Wales, in honour of
whom it was named the <i>Prince Royal</i>. It was in many
respects a remarkable departure from the prevailing practice
of the times, and, if stripped of its profuse carved work, was
very similar in outline to the men-of-war built as recently as
the commencement of the last century. The designer was
bold enough to abandon some of the time-honoured features of
ship construction, such as the beak, or prow, derived from the
old galleys, and the square buttock, or tuck. The latter
feature, however, continued to appear in the ships of most
other European countries for some time afterwards. The
length of keel of this vessel was 114 ft., and the beam 44 ft.
The reputed burthen was 1,400 tons, and the vessel was
pierced for 64 guns, whereof she carried 55, the vacant portholes
being filled in action from the opposite side, a custom
which prevailed down to the last century and was adopted
in order to lessen the dead weight carried aft. The great
difference between the shape of the quarter galleries and forecastle
in this ship and in the earlier types will be noted. The
armament of the <i>Prince Royal</i> consisted of the following guns:
On the lower deck six 32-pounders, two 24-pounders, and
twelve 18-pounders. The bow and aftermost ports were
empty, and in case of necessity the former was filled by
an 18-pounder from the opposite side, and the latter by a
24-pounder from the stern-ports. The upper deck was armed
with 9-pounders, the aftermost port being vacant, and filled
up when required. The quarter-deck and forecastle were
provided with 5-pounders.</p>

alt="The Prince Royal. 1610." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&mdash;The <i>Prince Royal</i>. 1610.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>The building of this ship aroused many apprehensions, and
a Commission was appointed to report on the design while it
was being constructed. It certainly seems that gross errors
were made in the calculations. For instance, it was estimated
that 775 loads of timber would be required for her construction,
whereas 1,627 loads were actually used. The timber also was
so unseasoned that the ship only lasted fifteen years, and had
then to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>Many complaints were made about this time of the incapacity
and ignorance of English shipbuilders. Sir Walter
Raleigh laid down the following as the principal requirements
of warships: strong build, speed, stout scantling, ability to
fight the guns in all weathers, ability to lie to easily in a gale,
and ability to stay well. He stated that in all these qualities
the royal ships were deficient. He also called attention to
the inferiority of our merchant-ships, and pointed out that,
whereas an English ship of 100 tons required a crew of thirty
hands, a Dutch vessel of the same size would sail with one-third
of that number.</p>

<p>Another authority of the time complained that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"he could never see two ships builded of the like proportion by the
best and most skilful shipwrights ... because they trust rather to
their judgment than their art, and to their eye than their scale and
compass."</p></div>

<p>The merchant navy of England languished during the early
years of the reign of James I. Owing, however, to the patronage
and assistance extended by the king to the East India
Company, and also in no small measure to the stimulus caused
by the arrival of some large Dutch merchantmen in the Thames,
the merchants of London abandond the practice of hiring
ships from foreigners and took to building for themselves. In
the year 1615 there were not more than ten ships belonging to
the Port of London with a burthen in excess of 200 tons, but,
owing to the sudden development of shipbuilding, the Port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of Newcastle in the year 1622 owned more than 100 ships
exceeding the above-mentioned tonnage.</p>

<p>In the year 1609 the king granted a new charter to the
East India Company, and in the following year a vessel, called
the <i>Trade's Increase</i>, was sent out. This ship was the largest
merchantman built up to that time in England. Her career,
however, was not fortunate. She was careened at Bantam, in
order that some repairs to her hull might be effected, but she
fell over on her side and was burnt by the Javanese.</p>

<p>Before the year 1613 British merchants had made altogether
twelve voyages to the East Indies, for the most part in ships
of less than 500 tons. In that year, however, all the merchants
interested in the Oriental trade joined together to form the
United East India Company. The first fleet fitted out by the
re-organised Company consisted of four ships, of 650, 500, 300,
and 200 tons burthen respectively. It had to fight its way
with the Portuguese before it could commence to trade. The
Portuguese considered that they were entitled to a monopoly
of the trade with the East, and jealously resented the intrusion
of the English merchantmen, whom they attacked with a fleet
of six galleons, three ships, two galleys, and sixty smaller
vessels. They were, however, ignominiously defeated, and
the English merchants were enabled to accomplish their
purpose.</p>

<p>During the last five years of the reign of James I. the
strength of the Royal Navy was increased twenty-five per cent.
His son and successor, Charles I., through all the troubles of
his eventful reign, never neglected this branch of the national
defences, and during his reign the Mercantile Marine grew to
such an extent that, at the time of the outbreak of the Civil
War, the port of London alone was able to furnish 100 ships of
considerable size, all mounting cannon and fitted up in every
respect for the operations of war.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>&mdash;The <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>. 1637.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>The <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#f48">48</a>, may be taken
as a sample of the largest type of warship built by Charles.
Like the <i>Prince Royal</i>, she was designed by Pett, and was
considered to be the most powerful man-of-war in Europe of
her time. Her construction must have been a great improvement
on that of the <i>Prince Royal</i>; for, whereas the latter
ship was declared to be no longer fit for service fifteen years
after her launch, the <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, though engaged in
most of the naval battles of the seventeenth century, remained
in good condition for a period of sixty years, and was then
accidentally burnt at Chatham when about to be rebuilt.
She was the first three-decker in the Royal Navy, but as she
proved somewhat crank, she was cut down to a two-decker
in the year 1652. At the Restoration she was renamed the
<i>Royal Sovereign</i>.</p>

<p>This very remarkable vessel was of 1,683 tons burthen. Her
length of keel was 128 ft.; length over all, 167 ft.; beam,
48 ft. 4 in.; and depth from top of lanthorn to bottom of keel,
76 ft. She was built with three closed decks, a forecastle, a
half-deck, a quarter-deck, and a round-house. She carried
in all 102 or 104 guns, and was pierced for thirty guns on the
lower, thirty on the main, and twenty-six on the upper deck;
the forecastle had twelve, and the half-deck fourteen ports.
She also carried ten chasers forward, and as many aft. She
was provided with eleven anchors, of which one weighed two
tons.</p>

<p>The <i>Royal Sovereign</i> may fairly be taken as representing the
commencement of a better school of ship construction. Her
merits were due to the talents of Phineas Pett, who, though not
uniformly successful in his earlier designs, was a great innovator,
and is generally regarded as the father of the modern
school of wooden shipbuilding.</p>

<p>Very little is known, unfortunately, of the character and rig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
of the smaller classes of trading vessels of the end of the
sixteenth and the commencement of the seventeenth centuries.
It is, however, tolerably certain that cutter-rigged craft were
used in the coasting and Irish trades as far back as 1567;
for there is a map of Ireland of that date in existence on which
are shown two vessels rigged in this manner.</p>

<p>With the description of the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> we close the
account of medi&aelig;val naval architecture. Thanks to the fostering
care of Charles I., to the genius of Pett, and to the great
natural advantages conferred by the superiority of English
oak to other European timbers, England at this period occupied
a high place in the art of shipbuilding. The position
thus gained was maintained and turned to the best advantage
in the period of the Commonwealth, when successful naval
wars were undertaken against the Dutch and other European
States. These wars eventually resulted in establishing
England, for a time, as the foremost maritime power in
Europe.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4>MODERN WOODEN SAILING-SHIPS.</h4>


<p>The naval wars which followed the establishment of the
Commonwealth contributed in a very large degree to the
progress of shipbuilding. In 1652 war broke out with the
United Provinces, headed by the Dutch, who were, prior to
that period, the foremost naval and mercantile power in the
world. The struggle lasted about two years, and during its
continuance the British fleet increased from fifty-five first,
second, and third rates, to eighty-eight vessels of corresponding
classes, while a proportionately larger increase was made in
ships of smaller denominations, and, in addition, the vessels
lost in the war were replaced. The war with the Dutch was an
exceptionally severe struggle, and ended in the complete
victory of this country, which then stepped into Holland's
place as foremost naval power. In addition to this war,
Cromwell undertook an expedition to the Mediterranean, to
punish the piratical states of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. The
fleet was commanded by Blake, and was completely successful
in its operations, which resulted in a security for British
commerce with the Levant that had never been known before.
Admiral Penn was at the same time entrusted with the command
of a powerful expedition to the Spanish West Indies.
The annexation of Jamaica followed, and British commerce in
the West increased. In fact, with the progress of the national
navy the commerce of the country also extended itself,
and the increased experience thus obtained in shipbuilding,
both for the war and trading fleets, necessarily resulted in
great improvements in the art.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>The expenditure on the navy in the time of the Commonwealth
was enormous relatively to the total national revenue.
In the year 1656-57 four-fifths of the income of the country was
devoted to the sea service, in the following year two-thirds, and
in 1658-59 nearly three-fifths. These are figures which have
never been approached at any other period. The ships built
during this time were of moderate dimensions. Only four
were of 1,000 tons. These were the <i>Dunbar</i>, of 1,047 tons
and 64 guns, built in 1656; the <i>London</i>, built in the
same year, of the same tonnage and number of guns,
though of different dimensions; the <i>Richard</i>, of 1,108
tons and 70 guns, built in 1658; and the <i>Naseby</i>, built
in 1655, of 1,229 tons and 80 guns. All four were renamed
at the Restoration.</p>

<p>Charles II. and his brother, the Duke of York, afterwards
James II., both possessed in an eminent degree the fondness
for the navy which distinguished all the members of the Stuart
dynasty, though, unfortunately, after the first naval war
waged by Charles against Holland, the condition of the fleet
was allowed to deteriorate very rapidly. As a sample of the
type of warship of the first class built in this reign, we give,
in Fig. <a href="#f49">49</a>, the <i>Royal Charles</i>, which was constructed at Portsmouth
dockyard in 1673, by Sir Anthony Deane, to carry 100
guns. This illustration and that of the <i>Sovereign of the
Seas</i> are after pictures by Vandevelde. This ship was the
largest in the navy, excepting always the famous old <i>Sovereign
of the Seas</i> and the <i>Britannia</i>. The latter was built at Chatham,
by Pett, in 1682, and carried 100 guns, and measured 1,739
tons. The <i>Royal Charles</i> created as much sensation in its day
as did the famous ship built for Charles I. There is a beautiful
model of the <i>Royal Charles</i> in the Museum.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#f50">50</a> is an illustration after Vandevelde of a famous
French first-rate of the same period, named the <i>Soleil Royal</i>, of
106 guns. She was destroyed in Cherbourg Bay the day
after the battle of Cape La Hogue, in 1692. Fig. <a href="#f51">51</a> is a Dutch
first-rate, named the <i>Hollandia</i>, of 74 guns. She was built
in 1683, and took part in the battle of Beachy Head as flagship
of Admiral Cornelis Evertsen.</p>

<p>The chief difference between the British and foreign builds
of warship of the latter half of the seventeenth century was that
the English vessels were always constructed with the rounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
tuck before mentioned, as introduced by Pett, while the Continental
ships all had the old-fashioned square tuck, which is
well illustrated in Fig. <a href="#f51">51</a>. The Dutch ships in one respect
excelled all others, in that they were the first in which the
absurd practice of an exaggerated "tumble home," or contraction
of the upper deck, was abandoned. This fashion was
still carried out to a very great extent by the English, and to a
less extent by the French and Spaniards. The chain-plates
in the English vessels were also fixed extremely low, while
the Dutch fixed them as high as the sills of the upper-deck
ports would allow. In consequence of the shallowness of the
Dutch harbours, the draught of their ships was also considerably
less than that of the English vessels of corresponding
force.</p>

<p>Most of the ships in a seventeenth-century fleet deemed fit to
take their station in the line of battle were third-rates. The
first and second rates were exceptional vessels, and were only
employed in particular services. A comparative table of the
dimensions and armament of the various rates, or classes in
the year 1688, is annexed:&mdash;</p>

<p><br />The first so-called frigate was designed by Peter Pett, and
built at Chatham in 1646. She was named the <i>Constant
Warwick</i>. Her dimensions were: length of keel, 85 ft.;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
breadth, 26 ft. 5 in.; depth, 13 ft. 2 in.; tonnage, 315;
guns, 32; crew, 140. She worked havoc amongst the privateers
of the time.</p>

<p>The bomb-ketch was originally introduced by a famous
French naval architect named Bernard Renan, about 1679.
This class of warship was first employed by Louis XIV. in the
bombardment of Algiers, where it produced an enormous effect.
Bomb-ketches were of about 200 tons burthen, very broad
in proportion to their length, and built with great regard to
strength, on account of the decks having to bear the downward
recoil of the mortars. The latter were placed in the fore-part
of the vessel, which was purposely left unencumbered with
rigging. The hold between the mortars and keel was closely
packed with old cables, cut into lengths. The yielding
elastic qualities of the packing assisted in taking up the force of
the recoil. The bombs weighed about 200 pounds, and the
consternation and terror produced by them may readily be
realized when it is remembered that, up to that time, the most
dangerous projectile which a warship could discharge at a land
fortification was a thirty-two pound shot. These vessels were
fitted with two masts, one in the middle and the other in the
stern.</p>

<p>While referring to this invention of Bernard Renan, it should
be mentioned that France rose to the rank of a great naval
power in the reign of Louis XIV., under the famous minister
Colbert, in the latter half of the seventeenth century. When
Louis succeeded to the throne the French Navy was practically
non-existent, as it consisted only of four, or five, frigates.
In 1672 he had raised the strength of the fleet to fifty line-of-battle
ships and a corresponding number of frigates and
smaller vessels. Nine years afterwards, the French marine
numbered 179 vessels of all classes, exclusive of galleys. In
1690 the French fleet in the Channel alone numbered sixty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>eight
ships, while the combined British and Dutch squadrons
consisted only of fifty-six, and suffered a defeat at Beachy
Head, in which the English lost one vessel and their allies six.
This defeat was, however, amply revenged two years afterwards,
when the allies succeeded in opposing the enormous
number of ninety-nine ships of the line, besides thirty-eight
frigates and fireships, to Tourville's fleet of forty-four ships of
the line and thirteen smaller vessels, and defeated it off Cape
La Hogue, inflicting on it a loss of fifteen line-of-battle ships,
including the famous <i>Soleil Royal</i>, of 108 guns, illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#f50">50</a>. From the time of Louis XIV. down to the present
date French naval architects have always exercised a most
important influence on the design of warships, a circumstance
which was largely due to the manner in which Colbert encouraged
the application of science to this branch of construction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
It may be truly said that, during the whole of the eighteenth
century, the majority of the improvements introduced in the
forms and proportions of vessels of the Royal Navy were
copied from French prizes.</p>

<p>It would be impossible in the present work to notice in
detail all the alterations in size and structure of ships which
took place during the eighteenth century. A few of the
leading changes may, however, be mentioned. In the year
1706 an attempt was made to systematize the dimensions
of the various rates, and the figures as given in the following
table were fixed:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the figures were compared with those of contemporary
French ships of the same rates, it was found that the British
vessels of every class were of inferior dimensions. Whenever
British men-of-war were captured by the French, the number
of their guns was reduced. It was universally admitted that
the French ships were superior in sailing qualities; so much
so was this the case that, whenever a French squadron was
chased, the English-built ships in it were the first to be overtaken.
The subject of the superiority in size of the French
ships was constantly coming to the front, and in 1719 a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
establishment was made for the dimension of ships in our
Royal Navy, according to the following scale:&mdash;</p>

<p>In addition to the increase in dimensions, much improvement
was made in the same year in the interior arrangements,
and in the preservation of the timber of which ships were
constructed. Up till this period both thick stuff and planks
were prepared by charring the inner surface while the outer
surface was kept wet, and this process was continued till
the plank was brought to a fit condition for bending to the
shape it was required to take. In this year, however, the
process of stoving was introduced. It consisted in placing
the timber in wet sand and subjecting it to the action of heat
for such time as was necessary in order to extract the residue
of the sap and to bring it to a condition of suppleness. In the
year 1726 the process was favourably reported on by two of
the master shipwrights in their report on the state of the
planking on the bottom of the <i>Falkland</i>. Some of the
planking had been charred by the old process, some stoved
by the new, and the remainder had been neither stoved nor
charred. The stoved planks were found to be in a good state
of preservation, while many of the others were rotten. The
process remained in use till 1736, when it was superseded by
the practice of steaming the timber. The steaming and the
kindred process of boiling remained in vogue during the whole
of the remainder of the era of wooden shipbuilding. In 1771
the rapid decay of ships in the Royal Navy once more caused
serious attention to be paid to the subject of the preservation
of timber. It was, in consequence, arranged that larger stocks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of timber should be kept in the dockyards, and that line-of-battle
ships should stand in frame for at least a year, in order
to season before the planking was put on. Similarly, frigates
were to stand in frame for at least six months, and all thick
stuff and planking was to be sawn out a year before it was used
and stacked, with battens between the planks, so as to allow
of the free circulation of the air. Similar regulations were put in
force for the beam pieces, knees, and other portions of the ships.</p>

<p>Much trouble was caused by the injurious effects of bilge-water
and foul air in the holds of ships, and various remedies
were devised from time to time. In 1715 structural improvements
were devised to allow of the bilge-water flowing more
freely to the pumps, and trunks were fitted to the lower
decks to convey air to the holds. In 1719 it was proposed
that the holds of ships should have several feet of water run
into them in the early spring in order to cool them, and that
it should not be pumped out till August; but this remedy
was never extensively practised. In 1753 Dr. S. Hales
proposed a system of ventilation by means of windmills and
hand-pumps, which produced excellent results. It was noticed
that the accumulation of carbonic acid gas and foul damp
air in the holds, not only set up rapid decay in the ship, but
also most injuriously affected the health of the crews. Dr.
Hales' system was employed in the <i>Prince</i> from 1753 to 1798,
and it was considered that the durability of this vessel had
been greatly increased. It was also reported by Lord Halifax
that the mortality on the non-ventilated ships on the coast of
Nova Scotia was twelve times as great as on those vessels
which were fitted with Dr. Hales' appliances.</p>

<p>There are not many records in existence of the merchant-vessels
of this period. Fig. <a href="#f54">54</a> is a representation of an armed
East Indiaman which was launched at Blackwall in 1752. Her
length of keel was 108 ft. 9 in.; breadth, 34 ft.; and burthen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>668 tons. She was named the <i>Falmouth</i>, and was constructed
by the famous shipbuilder, John Perry, of Blackwall Yard.
She was commenced almost exactly two years before the
date of her launch. Like all her class, she was heavily armed.</p>

<p>At the close of the war against France and Spain, which
lasted from 1744 to 1748, great complaints were made of the
weakness of our warships at sea. It was also found that the
establishment of 1719 had not been adhered to, and the
dimensions of ships were not fixed in accordance with any
particular standard. The first defect was remedied by the
placing of as many standards of wood, or iron, on the different
decks as could be conveniently arranged, so as not to interfere
with the guns, and by the use of larger bolts than had hitherto
been employed, as high up as possible in the throats of the
hanging knees. Also the beams of the quarter-deck and
round-house were supported with lodging knees, and in some
instances with hanging knees of wood, or iron. Various other
pieces, such as the stem, were also strengthened and the
weights of the taffrails and quarter-pieces were reduced.
The advice of the master shipwrights of the various dockyards
was sought, in order to fix a new establishment of dimensions,
but great difficulties were found in introducing the much-needed
reforms, and for some time afterwards the ships of the
British Navy were at a disadvantage with those of foreign
countries by reason of their contracted dimensions and inferior
forms.</p>

<p>The capture, with great difficulty, of a Spanish ship of
seventy guns, named the <i>Princessa</i>, in 1740, by three British
men-of-war of equal rating, but far inferior dimensions, was
one of the events that first opened the eyes of the Admiralty
to the defects of their vessels. The first attempt towards introducing
a better type of ship was made in 1746, when the
<i>Royal George</i>, famous for her size, her services, her beauty and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
misfortunes, was laid down. She was not launched till 1756.

<p>Fig. <a href="#f55">55</a> is an illustration of this ship. She rendered great services
to the country under the orders of Admiral Lord
Hawke, especially in the memorable defeat of the French
Navy off the island of Belle-isle in 1759. She was lost
at Spithead in 1782, when being inclined in order to
have some repairs to her bottom executed. She capsized,
and went under, 900 men, women, and children being
drowned in her.</p>

<p>The <i>Royal George</i> was followed by several others of various
rates and improved dimensions, notably by the <i>Blenheim</i> (90)
and the <i>Princess Amelia</i> (80). The latter was one of the most
famous ships of her day, and was constantly employed as long
as she continued fit for service. In 1747 a French ship of
seventy-four guns named the <i>Invincible</i> was captured, and
was found to be such an excellent vessel that her dimensions
were adopted for the <i>Thunderer</i>, laid down about 1758. One
of the most interesting models in the Museum is of the <i>Triumph</i>
(74), also built on the lines of the <i>Invincible</i> in 1764. Her
length of gun-decks was 171 ft. 3 in.; breadth, 49 ft. 9 in.;
depth of hold, 21 ft. 3 in.</p>

<p>In the following year was built the <i>Victory</i>, 100 guns,
famous as Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar, and still afloat in
Portsmouth Harbour. Her dimensions are: length of gun-deck,
186 ft.; breadth, 52 ft.; depth of hold, 21 ft. 6 in.;
tonnage, 2,162.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>The genuine frigate&mdash;that is to say, a large cruiser, of
relatively high speed, carrying its main armament on one
deck&mdash;was introduced into the Royal Navy in 1741, when the
<i>Adventure</i> was built. She carried thirty-two guns, of which
twenty-two were 12-pounders. The first British 36-gun
frigates were the <i>Brilliant</i> and <i>Pallas</i>, built in 1757. Their
main armament also consisted of 12-pounders. French frigates
of the same date were of larger dimensions, as is proved by

<p>In the year 1761 a most important improvement was introduced,
which greatly increased the usefulness of ships. This
was the discovery of the value of copper plates as a material
for sheathing their bottoms. Previously to this period lead
was the metal used for sheathing purposes, and even it was
only employed occasionally. In other cases the bottoms of
vessels were paid over with various compositions, the majority
of which fouled rapidly. The first vessel in the navy that was
copper-sheathed was the <i>Alarm</i>, a 32-gun frigate. At first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the use of copper caused serious oxidation of the iron bolts
employed in the bottom fastenings, and copper bolts were
substituted for them.</p>

<p>About the year 1788 the dimensions of the various rates were
again increased in order to keep pace with the improved
French and Spanish ships. In the year 1780 the 38-gun
frigate founded on a French model was introduced into the
navy, and continued to be much used throughout the
great wars at the close of the eighteenth and the commencement
of the nineteenth century. The first British frigate of this
rating was the <i>Minerva</i>, which measured 141 ft. in length of gun-deck;
38 ft. 10 in. width of beam; 13 ft. 9 in. depth of hold, and
940 tons&mdash;figures which were evidently based on those of the
<i>Aurore</i>, captured in 1758 (see p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>). In 1781 and 1782 two
very large French frigates were captured. Their names
were the <i>Artois</i> and <i>Aigle</i>, and they exceeded in size anything
in this class that had yet been built. The length of gun-deck
measured 158 ft.; width, 40 ft. 4 in.; depth of hold, 13 ft.
6 in.; tonnage, 1,152; they each carried 42 guns and 280 men.</p>

<p>Again, in 1790, the force of new ships of the various rates
was much increased. The largest line-of-battle ship then
built was the <i>Hibernia</i>, of 110 guns. She was the first of her
class introduced into the navy. Her dimensions were as
follows:&mdash;Length on gun-deck, 201 ft. 2 in.; extreme breadth,
53 ft. 1 in.; depth of hold, 22 ft. 4 in.; burthen in tons, 2,508.
The armament consisted of thirty 32-pounders on the lower
deck, thirty 24-pounders on the middle, and thirty-two 18-pounders
on the upper decks, while eighteen 12-pounders
were mounted on the forecastle and quarter-deck. It is worthy
of remark that, for some time previously, the large line-of-battle
ships carried 42-pounders on the lower deck, but it
was found that the 32-pounders could be loaded much more
quickly, and that a great advantage arose in consequence.</p>

<p>In the year 1792 the first 40-gun frigate, the <i>Acasta</i>, was
built. This type of vessel was intended to replace the old
44-gun two-decker. The <i>Acasta</i> measured 150 ft. on deck;
40 ft. 9&frac12; in. extreme breadth; 14 ft. 3 in. depth of hold;
with a burthen of 1,142 tons. Her armament consisted
of thirty 18-pounders on the main deck, and ten 9-pounder
long guns on quarter-deck and forecastle.</p>

<p>During the whole of our naval history down to comparatively
recent times, improvements in the dimensions and
forms of our ships were only carried out after they had been
originally adopted by the French, or Spaniards, or more
recently by the people of the United States of America.
Thus, we find that, shortly after war had been declared against
the French Revolutionary Government in 1792, Admiral
Hood took possession at Toulon, amongst other vessels, of a
French first-rate called the <i>Commerce de Marseille</i>, which was
larger and mounted more guns than any vessel in the service
of Great Britain. Fig. <a href="#f56">56</a> is an illustration of this fine man-of-war,
which was 208 ft. 4 in. long on the lower deck, 54 ft. 9&frac12; in.
broad, of 25 ft. depth of hold, and of 2,747 tons burthen. As
an instance of the progress in size, as related to armament,
made during the century, we may compare the dimensions
of this French first-rate with those of the <i>Royal Anne</i>, an
English 100-gun ship built in 1706. The length of gun-deck
of the latter ship was 171 ft. 9 in., and tonnage 1,809,
the more recent vessel showing an increase of nearly fifty per
cent. in tonnage for an increased armament of twenty guns.</p>

<p>As further examples of the naval architecture of this period,
in Figs. 57 and 58 are given views of an English first-rate of the
year 1794, and in Figs. 59 and 60 corresponding views of a
heavy French frigate of about the year 1780.</p>

<p>One of the greatest improvements made at the end of the
eighteenth century was the raising of the lower battery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>further above the water, so as to enable the heavy guns to be
fought in all weathers. It was frequently observed that the
old British men-of-war of seventy-four guns when engaging
a hostile vessel to leeward were, on account of the crankness
of the ship and the lowness of the battery, obliged to keep their
lower ports closed; whereas the French ships, which were
comparatively stiff, and carried their lower guns well above
the water, were enabled to fight with the whole of their battery
in all weathers.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>&mdash;British first-rate. 1794.</p></div>

<p>After the capture of the <i>Commerce de Marseille</i>, an English
first-rate, named the <i>Caledonia</i>, to carry 120 guns, was ordered
to be laid down. She was not, however, commenced till 1805.
Her dimensions and proportions closely approximated to
those of her French prototype, and need not, therefore, be
more particularly referred to. She was the first 120-gun ship
built in this country.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>&mdash;Heavy French frigate of 1780.</p></div>

<p>In the year 1812 the United States declared war against
Great Britain. The struggle was memorable for several
naval duels between the frigates of the two nations.
When the war broke out the United States possessed
some frigates of unusual dimensions and armament. The
British cruisers were quite overmatched, and in several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>instances were captured. In consequence of these disasters
a new and improved class of frigate was introduced into the
Royal Navy. What had happened in the case of the frigates
took place also in regard to the sloops employed as cruisers.
They were completely outmatched by the American vessels of
corresponding class, and many of them were taken.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>&mdash;Heavy French frigate of 1780.</p></div>

<p>In 1815, on the conclusion of the long wars with France,
there was, of course, a marked diminution in the number of
ships built for purposes of war. The <i>Howe</i>, of 120 guns
(Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a>), is given as an illustration of a first-rate of this period.</p>

<p>During the earlier years of the present century great improvements
were introduced by Sir Robert Seppings and others
into the structural arrangements of ships. During the long
wars abundant experience had been gained as to the particular
kinds of weakness which ships exhibited when exposed to the
strains produced by waves. It had been felt for many years
that the system of building was very defective, and the life
of a man-of-war was consequently short, only fifteen years
for a ship built of English oak in the Royal dockyards, and
about twelve years for similar vessels built in private yards.
Amongst the greatest defects was the absence of longitudinal
strength to enable a ship to resist the effects of hogging and
sagging strains in a sea-way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f61" id="f61"></a>
<img src="images/fig61.png" width="500" height="207"
alt="The Howe. 1815. 1746." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;The <i>Howe</i>. 1815.</p></div>

<p>When a ship at sea is so placed that the crest of a large wave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>is passing about the midship section, the two ends may happen
to be in the hollows between the waves, and in this case are to
a great extent unsupported by the water, and consequently
have a tendency to droop. The result is that the ship tends
to arch up in the centre like a hog's back, and the upper decks
are put into a state of tension, while the bottom of the vessel,
on the contrary, undergoes compression. The strains set up in
this way are called hogging strains. When the position of the
waves is exactly reversed so that the two ends are supported by
the crests, while the hollow between them passes under the
middle, the latter part of the ship has a tendency to droop or
sag, and the bottom is consequently extended, while the upper
works are put into a state of compression.</p>

<p>It will be noticed, on referring to the illustration of the <i>Royal
George</i> (Fig. <a href="#f55">55</a>), that the framework of ships built on the old
system consisted of a series of transverse ribs which were connected
together in the longitudinal direction by the outside
planking and by the ceiling. As there was no filling between
the ribs, the latter tended alternately to come closer together,
or recede further apart, according as they experienced the
influence of hogging or sagging stresses. The French during
the eighteenth century had at various times proposed methods
of overcoming this defect. One was to cross the ceiling with
oblique iron riders. Another was to lay the ceiling itself and
the outside planking diagonally. Sometimes the holds were
strengthened with vertical and sometimes with diagonal
riders, but none of these plans gave lasting satisfaction.</p>

<p>The means adopted by Sir Robert Seppings were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly, the spaces between the frames were filled in solid
with timber (Fig. <a href="#f62">62</a>). In this way the bottom of the ship was
transformed into a solid mass of timber admirably adapted to
resist working. At the same time the customary interior
planking below the orlop beams was omitted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f62" id="f62"></a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, the beams were connected with the sides of the
ship by means of thick longitudinal timbers below the knees
running fore and aft, called shelf-pieces, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> (Fig. <a href="#f63">63</a>), and
similar pieces above the beams, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> (Fig. <a href="#f63">63</a>), called waterways.
These not only added to the longitudinal strength of the ship,
but formed also very convenient features in the connection
between the deck-beams and the ship's sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f63" id="f63"></a>
<img src="images/fig63.png" width="500" height="473"
alt="Sir Robert Seppings' system of construction." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>&mdash;Sir Robert Seppings' system of construction.</p></div>

<p>Thirdly, a trussed frame was laid on the inside of the transverse
frames in the hold of the ship. This frame consisted of
diagonal riders making an angle of about 45&deg; with the vertical,
together with trusses crossing them, and longitudinal pieces, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#f62">62</a>. This trussed frame was firmly bolted
through the transverse frames and the planking of the ship.</p>

<p>Fourthly, it was proposed to lay the decks diagonally; but
this system does not appear to have ever come into general
use.</p>

<p>It should here be mentioned that the use of shelf-pieces and
thick waterways in connection with the ends of the beams was
first adopted by the French in very small vessels; also the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
system of fillings between the frames was an extension of a
method which had been in use for some time, for it was
customary to fill in the spaces as far as the heads of the floors,
in order to strengthen the ship's bottom against the shocks
and strains due to grounding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f64" id="f64"></a>

alt="Sir Robert Seppings' system of construction." title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>&mdash;Sir Robert Seppings' system of construction.</p></div>

<p>Sir Robert Seppings further introduced many minor improvements
into the details of the construction and the forms
of ships. Amongst these may be mentioned the method of
combining the frame-timbers. The old method of shaping the
heads and heels of these timbers and of combining them with
triangular chocks is shown on the left-hand side of Fig. <a href="#f64">64</a>.
In the new method the heads and heels were cut square, and
combined with circular coaks, as shown on the right-hand side
in the same Fig.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span>&mdash;The <i>Waterloo</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>The principal alterations in the forms of ships introduced by
Sir Robert Seppings, were connected with the shapes of the bow
and stern. Hitherto the bow was cut straight across at the
cathead, so as to form a vertical wall extending down to the
level of the upper deck portsills, and formed of thin boarding
and stanchions. The old shape of the bow is clearly shown in
Figs. 52 and 55. The disadvantage of this arrangement was
that it exposed the ship to the raking fire of an enemy. The
old form of bow was also deficient in structural strength, and
was liable to cause leakage. Sir Robert Seppings carried the
rounding of the bow right up to the upper deck, and made it as
strong as any other part of the ship to resist either shot or
stresses. This alteration also enabled him to provide for firing
several guns in a line with the keel. The old square stern
was also abolished and a circular one introduced, which
enabled a more powerful battery to be carried aft.</p>

<p>In order to bring up the account of British sailing line-of-battle
ships to the period when they were superseded by the
adoption of steam-power in the Royal Navy, we give illustrations
of a first-rate launched in the reign of William IV.,
called the <i>Waterloo</i> (Fig. <a href="#f65">65</a>), of 120 guns, and of the <i>Queen</i>
(Fig. <a href="#f66">66</a>), of 110 guns: the latter was the first three-decker
launched in the reign of Queen Victoria. A comparison of
these illustrations with those representing the largest men-of-war
in the time of the Stuart sovereigns, will do more than any
verbal description to show the great alterations in form and
size which had taken place during two centuries. The <i>Waterloo</i>
had a length on deck of 205 ft. 6 in., extreme breadth of
54 ft. 9 in., and a tonnage of 2,718; while the corresponding
dimensions of the <i>Queen</i> were 204 ft. 2&frac12; in., 55 ft. 2&frac12; in., and
3,104 tons.</p>

<p>During the epoch covered in this chapter the chronicles of
the British Mercantile Marine were extremely meagre. The
seaborne commerce of the country had increased enormously
since the time of the Restoration. It had, in fact, kept pace
with the development of the Royal Navy, and, in proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
as the naval power of the country was increased so was her
commerce extended and her Mercantile Marine increased. In
the year 1801 the total amount of British Mercantile shipping
was about 1,726,000 tons; in 1811 it had increased to 2,163,094
tons, and in 1816 to 2,489,068; while in 1846 it had reached
3,220,685 tons. The East India Company was by far the
largest mercantile shipowner and ship-hirer in the country.
In the year 1772 the Company employed 33 ships of the
aggregate burthen of 23,159 tons, builders' measurement.
It was about this period that the Company commenced the
construction of a larger type of vessel for their own use.
These vessels afterwards became famous for their exploits,
and were called East Indiamen. Fig. <a href="#f67">67</a> is an illustration of
one of them named the <i>Thames</i>, built in 1819, of 1,360 tons
register. She carried 26 guns, and had a crew of 130 men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span></p></div>

<p>East Indiamen were designed to serve simultaneously
as freight-carriers, passenger-ships and men-of-war. In the
latter capacity they fought many important actions and won
many victories. Having had to fill so many purposes, they
were naturally expensive ships both to build and work. Their
crews were nearly four times as numerous as would be required
for modern merchant sailing-ships of similar size.</p>

<p>At the close of the great wars in the early part of this century
commercial pursuits naturally received a strong impetus.
Great competition arose, not only between individual owners,
but also between the shipowning classes in various countries.
This caused considerable attention to be paid to the improvement
of merchant-ships. The objects sought to be attained
were greater economy in the working of vessels and increased
speed combined with cargo-carrying capacity. The trade
with the West Indies was not the subject of a monopoly as
that with the East had been. It was consequently the subject
of free competition amongst shipowners, and the natural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>result was the development of a class of vessel much better
adapted to purely mercantile operations than were the ships
owned or chartered by the East India Company. Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a> is a late
example of a West Indiaman, of the type common shortly after
the commencement of the nineteenth century. The capacity
for cargo of ships of this type was considerably in excess of
their nominal tonnage, whereas in the case of the East Indiamen
the reverse was the case. Also, the proportion of crew
to tonnage was one-half of what was found necessary in the
latter type of vessel. While possessing the above-named
advantages, the West Indiamen were good boats for their
time, both in sea-going qualities and in speed.</p>


<p>When the trade with the East was thrown open an impetus
was given to the construction of vessels which were suitable
for carrying freight to any part of the world. These boats were
known as "Free Traders." An illustration of one of them is
given in Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>. They were generally from 350 to 700 tons
register. The vessels of all the types above referred to were
very short, relatively, being rarely more than four beams in
length.</p>

<p>To the Americans belongs the credit of having effected the
greatest improvements in mercantile sailing-ships. In their
celebrated Baltimore clippers they increased the length to five
and even six times the beam, and thus secured greater sharpness
of the water-lines and improved speed in sailing. At
the same time, in order to reduce the cost of working, these
vessels were lightly rigged in proportion to their tonnage, and
mechanical devices, such as capstans and winches, were
substituted, wherever it was possible, for manual labour.
The crew, including officers, of an American clipper of 1,450
tons, English measurement, numbered about forty.</p>

<p>The part played by the Americans in the carrying trade of
the world during the period between the close of the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
wars and the early fifties was so important that a few illustrations
of the types of vessels they employed will be interesting.
Fig. <a href="#f70">70</a> represents an American cotton-ship, which
also carried passengers on the route between New York and
Havre in the year 1832. In form she was full and bluff; in
fact, little more than a box with rounded ends.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;The <i>Bazaar</i>. American cotton-ship. 1832.</p></div>

<p>In 1840, when steamers had already commenced to cross
the Atlantic, a much faster and better-shaped type of sailing-packet
was put upon the New York-Havre route. These
vessels were of from 800 to 1,000 tons. One of them, the
<i>Sir John Franklin</i>, is shown in Fig. <a href="#f71">71</a>. They offered to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>passengers the advantages of a quick passage, excellent
sea=going qualities, and, compared with the cotton-ships, most
comfortable quarters. The Americans had also about this
time admirable sailing-packets trading with British ports.</p>

<p>In the early fifties the doom of the sailing-packet on comparatively
short voyages, such as that between New York and
Western European ports, had been already sealed; but, for
distant countries, such as China and Australia, and for cargo-carrying
purposes in many trades, the sailing-ship was still able
to hold its own. Fig. <a href="#f72">72</a> represents an American three-masted
clipper called the <i>Ocean Herald</i>, built in the year 1855. She
was 245 ft. long, 45 ft. in beam, and of 2,135 tons. Her ratio
of length to breadth was 5.45 to 1.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#f73">73</a> is an illustration of the <i>Great Republic</i>, which was one
of the finest of the American clippers owned by Messrs. A.
Law and Co., of New York. She was 305 ft. long, 53 ft. beam,
30 ft. depth of hold, and of 3,400 tons. She was the first
vessel fitted with double topsails. Her spread of canvas,
without counting stay-sails, amounted to about 4,500 square
yards. She had four decks, and her timber structure was
strengthened from end to end with a diagonal lattice-work of
iron.</p>

<p>The speed attained by some of these vessels was most
remarkable. In 1851 the <i>Nightingale</i>, built at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, in a race from Shanghai to Deal, on one
occasion ran 336 knots in twenty-four hours. In the same
year the <i>Flying Cloud</i>, one of Donald McKay's American
clippers, ran 427 knots in twenty-four hours in a voyage from
New York to San Francisco. This performance was eclipsed
by that of another vessel belonging to the same owner, the
<i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, which on one occasion averaged over
eighteen miles an hour for twenty-four consecutive hours.
This vessel had a length of keel of 245 ft., 44 ft. 6 in.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>beam, and 25 ft. 6 in. depth of hold. She was of 2,421 tons
register.</p>



<p>English shipowners were very slow to adopt these improvements,
and it was not till the year 1850, after the abolition
of the navigation laws, that our countrymen really bestirred
themselves to produce sailing-ships which should rival and
even surpass those of the Americans. The legislation in question
so affected the prospects of British shipping, that nothing
but the closest attention to the qualities of vessels and to
economy in their navigation could save our carrying trade
from the effects of American competition. Mr. Richard
Green, of the Blackwall Line, was the first English shipbuilder
to take up the American challenge. In the year 1850 he laid
down the clipper ship the <i>Challenger</i>. About the same time,
Messrs. Jardine, Matheson, and Co. gave an order to an Aberdeen
firm of shipbuilders, Messrs. Hall and Co., to build two
sharp ships on the American model, but of stronger construction.
These vessels were named the <i>Stornoway</i> and <i>Chrysolite</i>,
and were the first of the celebrated class of Aberdeen clippers.
They were, however, only about half the dimensions of the
larger American ships, and were, naturally, no match for them
in sailing powers. The <i>Cairngorm</i>, built by the same firm,
was the first vessel which equalled the Americans in speed,
and, being of a stronger build, delivered her cargo in better
condition, and consequently was preferred. In 1856 the
<i>Lord of the Isles</i>, built by Messrs. Scott, of Greenock, beat two
of the fastest American clippers in a race to this country from
China, and from that time forward British merchant vessels
gradually regained their ascendency in a trade which our
transatlantic competitors had almost made their own.</p>

<p>It was not, however, by wooden sailing-ships that the
carrying trade of Great Britain was destined to eclipse that
of all her rivals. During a portion of the period covered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>in this chapter, two revolutions&mdash;one in the means of propulsion,
and the other in the materials of construction of
vessels&mdash;were slowly making their influence felt. About
twelve years before the close of the eighteenth century the
first really practical experiment was made on Dalswinton Loch,
by Messrs. Miller and Symington, on the utilization of steam
as a means of propulsion for vessels. An account of these experiments,
and of the subsequent application and development
of the invention, are given in the "Handbook on Marine
Engines and Boilers," and need not, therefore, be here referred
to at greater length.</p>

<p>The other great revolution was the introduction of iron
instead of wood as the material for constructing ships. The
history of that achievement forms part of the subject-matter
of Part II. During the first half of the nineteenth century,
good English oak had been becoming scarcer and more expensive.
Shortly after the Restoration the price paid for
native-grown oak was about &pound;2 15<i>s.</i> a load, this being double
its value in the reign of James I. The great consumption at the
end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the last century had
so diminished the supply, that in 1815, the year in which the
great Napoleonic wars terminated, the price had risen to &pound;7 7<i>s.</i>
a load, which was, probably, the highest figure ever reached.
In 1833 it sank to &pound;6, and then continued to rise till, in 1850,
it had reached &pound;6 18<i>s.</i> per load. In consequence of the
scarcity of English oak many foreign timbers, such as Dantzic
and Italian oak, Italian larch, fir, pitch pine, teak, and African
timbers were tried with varying success. In America timber
was abundant and cheap, and this was one of the causes which
led to the extraordinary development of American shipping in
the first half of the nineteenth century, and it is probable that,
but for the introduction of iron, which was produced abundantly
and cheaply in this country, the carrying trade of the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
would have passed definitely into the hands of the people of
the United States.</p>

<p>The use of iron and steel as the materials for construction
have enabled sailing ships to be built in modern times of
dimensions which could not have been thought of in the
olden days. These large vessels are chiefly employed in
carrying wheat and nitrate of soda from the west coast of
South America. Their structural arrangements do not differ
greatly from those of iron and steel steamers which are
described in Part II.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Description of a Greek Bireme of about 800 b.c.</span></h4>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;Archaic Greek bireme. About 800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> </p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>During the year 1899 the British Museum acquired a new vase of
the Dipylon class, which was found near Thebes in B&oelig;otia, and dates
from about 800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> On one side of the vase are represented chariots
and horses, apparently about to start for a race. On the other side
is a painting of a complete bireme, which, on account of its antiquity
and the peculiarities of its structure is of extraordinary interest. The
galley in question, Fig. <a href="#f74">74</a>, is reproduced from an illustration, traced
direct from the vase, and published in the "Journal of Hellenic Studies,"
vol. xix. (1899). The chief peculiarity of the construction is that the
rowers are seated upon a two-storied open staging, erected upon a very
shallow hull and extending from an elevated forecastle to an equally
raised structure at the stern. The stage, or platform, on which the
lower tier of oarsmen is seated, is supported by vertical struts rising
out of the body of the boat. The platform for the upper stage is also
supported by vertical struts, which rise, not from the boat itself, but
from an intermediate stage, situated between the two tiers of rowers.
In the absence of a plan it is not possible to say if these platforms were
floored decks, with openings cut in them, where necessary, for the legs
of the rowers; or if they were simply composed of longitudinal beams
connected by cross-pieces which served as seats, or benches. The latter
arrangement appears to be the more probable. There are twenty oarsmen
a-side, on the lower tier, and, apparently, nineteen on the upper.
No attempt is made by the artist to show more than the rowers on one
side, and, to avoid confusion, those on the two tiers have their oars on
the opposite sides of the galley, and only one of the blades of the far
side is shown. The men of the lower tier rest their feet against supports
fixed to the vertical struts which support their platform, while those
of the upper tier rest theirs, apparently, upon the intermediate stage.
The vessel is provided with a large and a small ram, and is steered by
means of two large paddles. The prow ornament resembles a snake.
In some of its features, notably in the shape of the ram, the shallowness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>of the hull, and the height and number of the stages, this galley resembles
the Ph&oelig;nician boat of a somewhat later date, described on page 28.
The arrangement of the rowers is, however, totally different in the
two cases, those in the Ph&oelig;nician vessel being all housed in the hull
proper, while those in the Greek galley are all placed on the stages. It
is a curious coincidence that the two specimens of galleys of the eighth
and seventh centuries <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, of which we possess illustrations, should
both be provided with these lofty open stages.</p>

<p>This Greek bireme, with its shallow hull and lofty, open superstructure,
could hardy have been a seaworthy vessel. The question
arises, What purpose could it have been intended to serve? The rams,
of course, suggest war; but the use of rams appears to have been
pretty general, even in small Greek rowing-boats, and has survived
into our own day in the Venetian gondola. The late Dr. A. S. Murray,
keeper of the Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum,
who wrote an account of the vase in the "Journal of Hellenic
Studies," is of opinion that both the subjects on this vase represent
processions, or races, held at the funeral ceremonies of some prominent
citizen, and that, in fact, all the subjects on Dipylon vases seem to
refer to deceased persons. He points out that Virgil mentions in the
<i>&AElig;neid</i> that games, held in honour of the deceased, commenced with
a race of ships, and that he could hardly have done this if there were
no authority for the practice. The large figures at the stern seem to
point to the bireme of Fig. <a href="#f74">74</a> being about to be used for racing purposes.
The man who is going to step on board is in the act of taking leave
of a woman, who holds away from him a crown, or prize, for which he
may be about to contend. If this view be correct we have, at once,
an explanation of the very peculiar structure of this bireme, which, with
its open sides and small freeboard, could only have been intended for
use in smooth water and, possibly, for racing purposes.</p>

<p>There are several other representations of Greek galleys, or of fragments
of them, in existence. Nearly all have been found on eighth-century
Dipylon vases, but, hitherto, no other specimen has been found
in which all the rowers are seated on an open stage. In the collection
of Dr. Sturge there is a vase of this period, ornamented with a painting
of a bireme, which is as rakish and elegant in appearance as Fig.
74 is clumsy. It also is propelled by 78, or perhaps 80, rowers. Those
of the lower tier are seated in the body of the boat, while those of the
upper bank on what appears to be a flying deck connecting the forecastle
and poop, and about 3 ft. to 3 ft. 6 in. above the seats of the
lower tier.</p>

<p>In the Museum of the Acropolis there are also some fragments of
Dipylon vases, on which are clearly visible portions of biremes. The
rowers of the lower bank are here again, seated in the hull of the galley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and appear to be working their oars in large square portholes, while
the upper row are seated on a flying deck, the space between which
and the gunwale of the hull is partly closed in by what appear to be
patches of awning or light fencing. The portholes above referred
to are in fact merely open intervals between the closed-in spaces.
Similar lengths of fencing may be seen in the representation of a
Ph&oelig;nician galley (Fig. <a href="#f7">7</a>, p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>).</p>

<p>From the above description it is not difficult to see how the galley,
with two tiers of oars, came to be evolved from the more primitive
unireme. First, a flying deck was added for the accommodation of
the upper tier of rowers. It formed no part of the structure of the
ship, but was supported on the latter by means of struts, or pillars.
The spaces between the hull and the flying deck at the two ends of
the galley were closed in by a raised forecastle and poop. These
additions were necessary in order to keep the vessel dry, and attempts
were no doubt made to give protection to the remainder of the sides
by means of the patches of light awning mentioned above. The step
from this to carrying the structure of the sides up bodily, till they
met the upper deck, and of cutting portholes for the lower tier of
oars, would not be a long one, and would produce the type of bireme
illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a> (Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>
